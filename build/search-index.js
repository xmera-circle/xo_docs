Beispiele sind z.B. Maßnahmen, Risikobewertungen oder Vorfälle. Ein Aufgabentyp ermöglicht es nach bestimmten Aufgaben zu suchen, zu filtern oder sie zu gruppiern, die Attribute zu bestimmen (Standardfelder oder eigene Felder) die bearbeitet werden, die Nutzbarkeit auf ausgewählte Objektklassen zu begrenzen, einen spezifischen Workflow abzubilden. Aufgabentypen können von einem Administrator ergänzt, bearbeitet und gelöscht werden. Ein Klick auf Aufgabentyp im Administrationsbereich führt zur Aufgabentypliste. In dieser Liste werden alle vorhandenen Aufgabentypen mit ihrem Standardstatus und der Beschreibung angezeigt. In der oberen rechten Ecke befinden sich Schaltflächen, um einen neuen Aufgabentyp zu erstellen oder die Zusammenfassung einzublenden. Um einen Aufgabentyp zu bearbeiten, klickt man in der Liste auf den Namen des zu bearbeitenden Aufgabentyps. In dieser Maske werden allgemeine Daten, eingeblendete Felder und die Objektklassenauswahl festgelegt. Allgemeine Daten Allgemeine Daten werden im oberen linken Bereich definiert. In diesem Bereich werden folgende Attribute abgefragt: Name: Die Bezeichnung für den Aufgabentyp, Standardstatus: Status, der beim Erstellen einer Aufgabe von diesem Typ gesetzt wird, im Stapel anzeigen: Option, ob dieser Aufgabentyp standardmäßig im Paketstapel automatisch angezeigt werden soll, Beschreibung: Beschreibung des Aufgabentyps zur leichteren Zuordnung im Betrieb. Die Beschreibung ist für den Anwender beim Bearbeiten einer Aufgabe sichtbar. Der Name und der Standardstatus sind dabei Pflichtfelder. Bei der Änderung des Namens bleiben die Verknüpfungen zu den Aufgaben erhalten. Mit Klick auf den Button werden die Änderungen übernommen. Eingeblendete Felder Unterhalb der allgemeinen Daten können die Formularfelder ausgewählt werden, die für diesen Aufgabentyp benötigt werden. Zum einen können Standardfelder, die optional sind, ein- und ausgeblendet werden. Zum anderen können diesem Aufgabentyp eigene Felder zugeordnet werden. Mit Klick auf den Button werden die Änderungen übernommen. Objektklassenauswahl Die Objektklassenauswahl ermöglicht es, den Aufgabentyp nur bei bestimmten Objektklassen anzuzeigen. Durch Klick auf den grünen Haken neben der Blocküberschrift lassen sich alle Objektklassen aus- und abwählen.

Der Button Aktivierung steht zur Verfügung, wenn sich ein Benutzer registriert hat und die Registrierung noch nicht bestätigt wurde. Der Benutzer admin wird bei der Installation angelegt. Über den Administrator können die ersten Einstellungen erfolgen und weitere Benutzer angelegt werden. Das Anlegen eines Benutzers kann auf verschieden Arten erfolgen: durch eine manuelle Erfassung im Administrationsbereich, durch einen CSV-Import im Administrationsbereich, durch eine Selbstregistrierung des Nutzers, durch eine LDAP-Kopplung. Die verschiedenen Arten werden im Folgenden beschrieben. Ein neuer Benutzer kann über den Button angelegt werden. Mit dem Klick wird folgendes Formular eingeblendet: Das Formular ähnelt sehr dem des Benutzerkontos wie es im Anwenderhandbuch im Kapitel Mein Konto beschrieben ist. Im Vergleich zur Bearbeitung des Benutzerkontos: wird der Mitgliedsname (Benutzer-ID) gefordert, besteht die Möglichkeit den Nutzer Administrationsrechte zu geben, besteht im Bereich der Authentifizierung die Möglichkeit automatisch ein Passwort zu generieren, ein Ändern des Passworts bei der nächsten Benutzeranmeldung zu erzwingen können dem Benutzer per E-Mail seine Kontodaten gesendet werden. Die Parametrierung der 2-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA) steht in der Administratoransicht des Benutzerkontos nicht zur Verfügung.

Das Hochladen kann per Auswahl über den Dateimanager oder per Drag & Drop erfolgen. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um zu den CSV-Optionen zu kommen. CSV Optionen definieren Die konkrete Wahl der CSV-Optionen hängt davon ab, wie die CSV-Datei erstellt wurde. Für die Kodierung ist im Normalfall UTF-8 die beste Wahl. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um die Datenfelder zuordnen zu können. Datenfelder zuordnen Wenn die Importdatei gut vorbereitet wurde, können alle Datenfelder automatisch zugeordnet werden. Andernfalls, muss eine manuelle Zuordnung durchgeführt werden. Dann auf Importieren klicken, um den Import zu starten Import durchführen Während des Imports kann anhand des Zählers der Importfortschritt beobachtet werden. Wenn der Import erfolgreich verlief, wird eine Liste der neuen Objekte angezeigt. Andernfalls erhält der Benutzer entsprechende Fehlermeldungen wie beispielhaft unten im Bild zu sehen ist. Der Importprozess wird nicht abgebrochen, wenn eine oder mehrere Zeilen nicht verarbeitet werden können. Die nicht importierten Zeilen werden in Form ihrer Positionsnummer in der Fehlermeldung angezeigt und müssen separat in einem zweiten Versuch importiert werden. Über die Konfiguration kann bei der Authentifizierung die Selbstregistrierung gewählt werden. Bei dieser Art, kann sich ein neuer Benutzer mit seinen Daten (Mitgliedsnamen, Vor- und Nachnamen, E-Mailadresse und Passwort) registrieren. Je nach Anmeldeoption kann der registrierte Benutzer automatisch, nach einer E-Mailbestätigung oder durch einen Administrator aktiviert werden. Benutzer können über eine LDAP-Kopplung mit einem LDAP-Server verwaltet werden. Die Anbindung und die Funktionen werden im Kapitel LDAP-Authentifizierung beschrieben. Durch Klick auf den Mitgliedsnamen in der Benutzerliste gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsmaske des Benutzers. Im oberen Bereich finden sich mehrere Taps und Funktionsbutton. Benutzerprofil Ein Klick auf den Button führt auf das Profil des Benutzers, in dem die zugewiesenen Aufgaben und sonstige Aktivitäten aufgezeigt werden. E-Mails Durch Klick auf den Button können dem Anwender weitere E-Mailadressen zugewiesen werden. Die Bedienung ist im Anwenderhandbuch im Kapitel Mein Konto beschrieben. Sperren / Entsperren Weiter kann das Konto durch Klick auf den Button gesperrt bzw. entsperrt werden. Löschen Durch Klick auf den Button kann das Benutzerkonto gelöscht werden. Es muss dann nochmals bestätigt werden, dass der Benutzer gelöscht werden soll. Das Löschen kann nicht rückgängig gemacht werden. Mit dem Löschen gehen alle Referenzen zu dem Benutzer verloren. Häufig ist es sinnvoller den Benutzer nur zu sperren. Bearbeitungsmasken Über die drei Taps werden die Bearbeitungsmasken für die allgemeinen Daten, die Gruppenzuordnung und die Objektrollen dargestellt. Diese werden im Folgenden beschrieben. Im Tap Allgemein können die Kontodaten des Benutzers angepasst werden. Das Formular entspricht dem beim manuellen Anlegen eines Benutzers. Die Beschreibungen zu den einzelen Feldern / Attributen finden sich im Adminhandbuch im Kapitel manuell Anlegen und im Anwenderhandbuch im Kapitel Mein Konto. Im Tap Gruppen sind die Gruppen aktiviert, denen der Benutzer zugeordnet ist. In dem Beispiel oben sind es das DSMS-Team und das ISMS-Team. Durch Setzen oder Entfernen der Haken vor den Gruppen und dem anschließenden Speichern kann die Gruppenzuordnung geändert werden. Der Tap Objekte zeigt die Objekte an, in denen der Benutzer Rechte mittels einer oder mehrerer Rollen besitzt. Im Beispiel unten hat der Benutzer in einem der gelisteten Objekte gleich zwei Rollen. In diesem Fall kummulieren sich die Rechte. Objektzuordnung ändern Die Rollenzuordnung zu jedem einzelnen Objekt kann in der Objektkonfiguration im Tab Mitglieder festgelegt werden. Der Administrator hat aber auch hier die Möglichkeit die Zuordnung zu bearbeiten. Die Rollen, die ein Benutzer in einem der aufgeführten Objekte hat, kann über den Button erfolgen. Es werden verfügbare Rollen gelistet und durch Setzen oder Entfernen der Häkchen werden die Rollen aktiviert oder deaktiviert. Durch Speichern werden die Änderungen übernommen. Rechte, die der Benutzer durch die Gruppenzugehörigkeit erhalten hat, können an dieser Stelle nicht verändert werden. Ebenso lassen sich diese Objektzuordnungen nicht löschen. Objektzuordnung löschen Durch den Button kann die Rolle in einem Objekt komplett gelöscht werden. Objektzuordnung hinzufügen Soll ein Benutzer Rollen in Objekten erhalten, die noch nicht in der Liste enthalten sind, so erfolgt dieses über den Button .

In der sich öffnenden Rollenmaske sind alle Einstellungen aus der Vorlage übernommen. In der Maske muss der Name der neuen Rolle eingetragen werden. Alle Einträge können bearbeitet werden. Mit dem Klick auf den Button wird die neue Rolle erstellt. Aus der Rollenliste kann eine Rolle über den Button gelöscht werden. Das Löschen muss bestätigt werden. Falls die Rolle in Verwendung ist, wird der Löschvorgang mit folgender Meldung abgebrochen. Zum Anlegen einer neuen Rolle ist ein Klick auf den Button notwendig. Es wird eine Bearbeitungsmaske geöffnet. Eine Besonderheit ist, dass bei der Erstellung einer neuen Rolle die Möglichkeit besteht, einen bestehenden Workflow von einer bestehenden Rolle zu kopieren. Wenn eine bestehende Rolle einen gleichen oder auch nur ähnlichen Ablauf hat, macht das Kopieren Sinn, da die komplette Erstellung eines Workflows aufwendig sein kann. Ein späteres Kopieren eines Workflows ist auch noch über die Kopierfunktion im Workflow selbst möglich. Die Berechtigungsübersicht zeigt in einer Kreuztabelle die Berechtigungen der Rollen in den Modulen an. Die Modulrechte sind den Zeilen der Tabelle zu entnehmen. Die Rollen können aus den Spalten abgelesen werden. In der Übersicht können die Rechte angepasst werden. Mit dem Klick auf werden die Änderungen übernommen. Der horizontale Scrollbalken ist unterhalb der (langen) Tabelle. Um das auf- und ab-scrollen zu vermeiden, kann auch über Drücken der Shift-Taste und dem Scroll-Rad der Maus horizontal gescrollt werden. Um die Übersichtlichkeit zu erhöhen, können die Rollen, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, gefiltert werden. Weiter können die Rechte der einzelnen Module durch Klicken auf den grauen Pfeil ein- und ausgeklappt werden. Auf diese Weise lassen sich die Berechtigungen der einzelnen Rollen auf übersichtliche Art vergleichen und ggf. anpassen.","title":"Rollen und Rechte","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"rollen-rechte","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/adminhandbuch/rollen-rechte.html","titles":[{"text":"Rollenliste","hash":"_rollenliste","id":1},{"text":"Rollen bearbeiten","hash":"_rollen_bearbeiten","id":2},{"text":"Rollen kopieren","hash":"_rollen_kopieren","id":3},{"text":"Rollen löschen","hash":"_rollen_löschen","id":4},{"text":"Neue Rolle anlegen","hash":"_neue_rolle_anlegen","id":5},{"text":"Berechtigungsübersicht","hash":"_berechtigungsübersicht","id":6}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Unsere Kunden erhalten auf alle Fragen zur Anwendung und zum Betrieb ihres Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystem mit xmera Omnia umfassende Anworten von uns.

Dabei kann es von Bedeutung sein, welcher Mitarbeiter oder welche Rolle eine Statusänderung vornehmen darf. Die Abfolge der Status und die Berechtigungen zur Statusänderung können mit Hilfe der Workflows gesteuert werden. So kann z.B. nur Mitgliedern, die die Rolle Aufgabenverantwortlich haben, das Recht gegeben werden, eine Aufgabe auf den Status storniert zu setzen. Weiter bieten Workflows die Möglichkeit, die Sichtbarkeit und Bearbeitbarkeit jedes einzelnen Aufgabendatenfeldes für jede Rolle festzulegen. Somit kann auch hier eine rollenbasierte Bearbeitung der Aufgaben abgebildet werden. Ein Workflow beschreibt damit die Rechte einer Rolle für einem Aufgabentyp in Bezug auf erlaubte Statusänderungen und die Bearbeitung von Aufgabendatenfeldern. Ist für einen Aufgabentyp kein Workflow definiert, so kann der Aufgabentyp zwar einer Aufgabe zugeordnet werden. Jedoch kann der Status dann von keiner Rolle (einschließlich Administrator) mehr verändert werden. Bearbeitet werden die Workflows im Administrationsbereich über den Menüpunkt Workflow. Es erscheint folgende Ansicht: In der Erstansicht werden zwei Tabs, Statusänderungen und Feldberechtigungen, angeboten. In beiden Tabs ist für die Bearbeitung die Kombination aus Rolle und Aufgabentyp festzulegen. Mit dem Button wird für die gewählte Kombination der Bearbeitungsbereich eingeblendet. Workflows müssen nicht vom Administrator angelegt werden, da mit dem Anlegen einer Rolle oder eines Aufgabentyps automatisch ein Workflow ohne Rechte zur Statusänderung und den vollen Rechten zur Feldberechtigung angelegt wird. Die Darstellung und Bearbeitung der Berechtigungen einer Rolle in einem Aufgabentyp erfolgt, in dem auf der Workflowseite die Rolle und der Aufgabentyp gewählt werden und diese Auswahl mit dem Button aufgerufen wird. Es wird, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, eine Statusmatrix angezeigt. Die Zeilen beschreiben den Ausgangsstatus, aus dem eine Änderung erfolgen soll. Die Spalten beschreiben die Zielstatus, in die der Ausgangsstatus verändert werden kann. Die Statusmatrix im Bild oben zeigt eine Rolle, die keine Rechte hat, einen Status zu verändern. So kann in dem Beispiel die Rolle Meldungsberechtigter eine Aufgabe von dem Typ Meldung anlegen, aber dabei keinen Status wählen, da in der Zeile Neue Aufgabe kein Zielstatus angekreuzt ist. Bei den anderen Zeilen ist (automatisch) jeweils nur der Haken beim Zielstatus gleich Ausgangsstatus gesetzt, womit keine Statusänderung für diese Rolle möglich ist. Um Statusänderungen durchführen zu können, muss für den entsprechenden Ausgangsstatus der Zielstatus definiert werden, damit die gewählte Rolle einen Bearbeitungsschritt einleiten oder abschließen kann. In dem Beispiel oben darf die Rolle aus dem Status In Bearbeitung in den Status Umgesetzt oder Feedback gesetzt werden. Aus dem Status Feedback kann die Aufgabe wiederum in den Status In Bearbeitung zurück versetzt werden. In der Standardeinstellung ist die Einstellung Zeige nur die Status an, die von diesem Aufgabentyp verwendet werden aktiviert. Wird die Einstellung zurückgenommen (siehe roter Kringel im folgenden Bild), werden alle im System vorhandenen Status angezeigt. Somit lassen sich für den Aufgabentyp weitere Status in den Workflow einbinden. Übernommen werden die Änderungen mit dem Klick auf den Button . Unterhalb der Statusmatrix können erweiterte Statusberechtigungen für den Autor oder das zugewiesenen Mitglied vorgenommen werden. Die Statusmatrix für diese besonderen Rollen kann durch Klick auf den Pfeil (rote Kreise in den Bildern unten) neben der Überschrift ein- und ausgeblendet werden. Werden in diesen Matrizen weitere Berechtigungen festgelegt, kann ein Autor oder das zugewiesene Mitglied mit der Rolle des Workflows diese erweiterten Rechte nutzen. Im Tab Feldberechtigung besteht die Möglichkeit jedes Aufgabendatenfeld für die gewählte Rolle in Abhängigkeit vom Status der Aufgabe für die Bearbeitung zu sperren (Nur-Lese-Zugriff) oder zum Pflichtfeld zu machen (Erforderlich). Dieses wird, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, in einer Feld/Status-Matrix umgesetzt. Für jede Feld-Status-Kombination kann die Berechtigung verändert werden. Dafür können über das Dropdown-Menü die Einträge verändert werden. Bei Pflichtfeldern steht die Auswahl Erforderlich nicht zur Verfügung, da dieses Feld bereits diesen Status besitzt. Mit dem Klick auf den Button , der unterhalb oder rechts vom Auswahlfeld ist, kann die Feldberechtigung in die folgenden Felder kopiert werden. Ein Beispiel ist im folgenden Bild zu sehen. Das Feld Zugewiesen an ist im Status Neu optional. Wird der Status in Bearbeitung gesetzt, ist es ein Pflichtfeld. In den weiteren Status kann es nicht verändert werden. Da der Aufwand, einen Aufgabentyp per Workflows zu definieren, recht hoch ist, ist das Kopieren und anschließende Anpassen der kopierten Workflows häufig der sinnvollere Weg. Aus diesem Grund wird bei der Erstellung einer Rolle oder Erstellung eines Aufgabentyps direkt das Kopieren der Workflows von einer bestehenden Rolle oder eines bestehenden Aufgabentyps angeboten. Dieses kann aber auch im Nachgang über die Kopierfunktion im Workflowbereich umgesetzt werden. Im oberen rechten Bereich kann die Kopierfunktion über den Button aufgerufen werden. Er erscheint folgende Eingabemöglichkeit: In dieser Maske kann im Bereich Quelle eine Kombination aus Aufgabentyp und Rolle gewählt werden. Dieser Workflow wird dann in eine oder mehrere Workflows (im Bereich Ziel ist eine Mehrfachauswahl möglich) kopiert. Um nicht jeden Workflow einzeln kopieren zu müssen, kann als Quelle So wie das Ziel definiert werden. Somit ist es auf diese Weise zum Beispiel möglich, einer Zielrolle alle Rechte einer Quellrolle zuzuordnen, in dem als Quellaufgabentyp die Auswahl So wie das Ziel gewählt wird und über die Mehrfachauswahl im Zielaufgabentyp alle Aufgabentypen ausgewählt werden. Im oberen rechten Bereich der Workflowseite kann durch Klick auf den Button die Zusammenfassung der Workflows aufgerufen werden. Die Zusammenfassung ist eine Kreuztabelle. In den Zeilen werden die Aufgabentypen und in den Spalten die Rollen dargestellt. Jede Kombination aus Aufgabentyp und Rolle bildet einen Workflow ab. In dem Kreuzungspunkt wird die Anzahl der Rechte zum Statuswechsel angezeigt. Ist die Anzahl Null, so wird ein X dargestellt. Durch Klick auf die Zahl bzw. das X wird der zugehörige Workflow eingeblendet. Reicht die Monitorbreite nicht aus, so wird im unteren Bereich der Kreuztabelle ein Scrollbalken angeboten.","title":"Workflow","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"workflow","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/adminhandbuch/workflow.html","titles":[{"text":"Statusänderungen bearbeiten","hash":"_statusänderungen_bearbeiten","id":1},{"text":"Feldberechtigungen bearbeiten","hash":"_feldberechtigungen_bearbeiten","id":2},{"text":"Kopieren","hash":"_kopieren","id":3},{"text":"Zusammenfassen","hash":"_zusammenfassen","id":4}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Das Modul Aufgaben-Synchronisation ist entwickelt worden, um die Modellierung von Sicherheitsanforderungen, Zuordnung von Gefährdungen oder eigenen Anforderungen/Aufgaben im ISMS-Umfeld automatisiert durchführen zu können. Die Synchronisation dient der automatisierten Zuordnung von Aufgaben zu Objekten. Zur Durchführung einer Synchronisation müssen einige Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: Es existiert ein Katalog-Objekt, das die zu synchronisierenden Elemente enthält. Das Katalog-Objekt wurde innerhalb der globalen Konfiguration angegeben. Ein Eigenes Feld wurde innerhalb der globalen Konfiguration als Zuordnungselement gewählt. Das Modul Aufgaben-Synchronisation ist in dem zu synchronisierenden Objekt aktiviert und konfiguriert. In der Administration wird festgelegt, in welchem Objekt die Aufgaben liegen, die synchronisiert werden sollen (Katalog-Objekt). Weiter wird festgelegt, welche Aufgabentypen zur Synchronisation genutzt werden können und in welchem eigenen Feld die Zuordnungselemente abgebildet werden. Die zu synchronisierenden Aufgaben müssen dieses Eigenes Feld besitzen und dem gewählten Aufgabentyp entsprechen. In dem zu synchronisierenden Objekt muss das Modul Aufgaben-Synchronisation aktiviert sein und es muss in der Modulkonfiguration mindestens ein möglicher Wert als Zuordnungselement ausgewählt sein. Bei der Synchronisation werden die Standard-Kopiermechanismen des Systems genutzt, so dass hier die in der Administration gewählte Option, wie mit der Verlinkung beim Kopieren umgegangen wird, auch für den Synchronisationsprozess gilt. Gestartet wird die Aufgaben-Synchronisation aus dem Reiter Aufgaben. Hier wird bei Aktivierung des Moduls Aufgaben-Synchronisation im 3-Punkte-Menü die Auswahl Synchronisieren angeboten. Mit dem Klick auf Synchronisieren wird der Synchoronisationsdialog geöffnet. In dieser Maske werden zunächst Quell- und Zielobjekt dargestellt. Wenn bei der Aufgabensynchronisation mehrere Aufgabentypen für die Synchronisation konfiguriert wurden, besteht die Möglichkeit, die Synchronisation auf einen (Dropdown) oder mehrere ( + ) Aufgabentypen einzugrenzen. Nach einer Änderung in der Auswahl eines Aufgabentyps muss durch einen Klick auf Aktualisieren die Neuberechnung der zu synchronisierenden Aufgaben angestoßen werden. Unterhalb der Auswahl der Aufgabentypen werden die Zielobjektklassen aufgelistet. Im Beispiel sind es die Klassen: Büroraum, Home-Office/Mobiler Arbeitsplatz, Serverraum, Technikraum. Es wird die Anzahl an Aufgaben dargestellt (im Beispiel 4 Aufgaben), die synchronisiert werden können. Klappt man den Bereich auf, werden die Aufgaben konkret aufgelistet. Mit dem Klick auf den Button wird der Synchronisationsprozess gestartet. Um das Bündeln von Aufgaben an einem überlagerten Objekt zu ermöglichen, steht die Funktionalität des Systemobjekts zur Verfügung. Ist ein Objekt ein Systemobjekt, so werden beim Synchronisieren nicht nur die Kriterien des Systemobjekts, sondern auch die aus den hierarchisch unterlagerten Objekten berücksichtigt. Wird die Synchronisation an einem Objekt durchgeführt, das ein überlagertes Systemobjekt besitzt, wird die Synchronisation mit der Fehlermeldung (Objektname) wird über sein übergeordnetes Objekt synchronisiert. abgebrochen. Beispiel: Das Systemobjekt wird in der Modulkonfiguration des Objektes festgelegt. Werden in einem Hierarchiebaum mehrere Systemobjekte gesetzt, so kann die Synchronisation nur am obersten Objekt ausgeführt werden, da alle unterlagerten Objekte ein überlagertes Systemobjekt besitzen und damit (siehe Notiz oben) der Synchronisationsprozess abgebrochen wird.","title":"Aufgaben-Synchronisation","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"aufgaben-synchronisation","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/anwenderhandbuch/aufgaben-synchronisation.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktionen Aufgaben-Synchronisation","hash":"_funktionen_aufgaben_synchronisation","id":1},{"text":"Voraussetungen zur Synchronisation","hash":"_voraussetungen_zur_synchronisation","id":2},{"text":"Starten und Durchführen der Synchronisation","hash":"_starten_und_durchführen_der_synchronisation","id":3},{"text":"Funktionsweise Systemobjekt","hash":"_funktionsweise_systemobjekt","id":4}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"Mein Konto enthält Einstellungen, die ein Nutzer zu seinem Benutzerkonto machen kann.

Für die Nutzung von Umlauten ist die Kodierung UTF-8 zu wählen. über den Button Aufgabe anlegen wird das Formular zum Anlegen einer Aufgabe geöffnet. In diesem Formular werden alle Basisdaten für eine Aufgabe erfasst. Die Pflichtfelder sind mit einem roten * gekennzeichnet. ➊ Das Attribut Objekt gibt an, welchem Objekt die Aufgabe zugeordnet ist. Dieses Attribut wird mit dem Objekt vorbelegt, aus dem die Erstellungsmaske aufgerufen wurde. ➋ Der Formularaufbau mit den zu erfassenden Daten und der Statusführung (Workflow) hängt vom Aufgabentyp ab. Mit der Auswahl eines Aufgabentyps wird das zugehörige Formular neu geladen, um alle aufgabenspezifischen Felder anzeigen zu können. Das Bild oben zeigt den Aufgabentyp Maßnahme, der Eingabefelder zur Wirksamkeitsprüfung enthält. ➌ Das Thema ist die Kurzbeschreibung der Aufgabe. Es wird in der Aufgabenübersicht dargestellt und sollte daher die Aufgabe so beschreiben, dass diese sich von den anderen Aufgaben im Objekt unterscheidet. ➍ Im Beschreibungsfeld kann die Aufgabe ausführlich erklärt werden. Zur Formatierung des Textes steht die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. ➎ Der Status gibt den Bearbeitungsstand der Aufgabe wieder. Zu jedem Aufgabetyp gibt es einen Startwert. Die Statusführung wird durch die Administration für jeden Aufgabentyp einzeln festgelegt. ➏ Hier wird die Priorität festgelegt. Es werden im Standard - Niedrig - Normal - Hoch - Dringend - Sofort unterschieden. Die Prioritäten lassen sich durch den Administrator anpassen. ➐ Mit diesem Feld wird festgelegt, wer für die Durchführung der Aufgabe verantwortlich ist. Zur Auswahl stehen alle Benutzer, die in dem der Aufgabe zugewiesenen Objekt das Recht besitzen, Aufgaben auszuführen. ➑ Aufgaben können hierarchisch organisiert werden. In der Unteraufgabe wird dazu die übergeordnete Aufgabe angegeben. Weitere Erläuterungen sind im Abschnitt Unteraufgabe. ➒ Mit dem Datum für den Beginn und dem Abgabedatum der Aufgabe kann der Zeitrahmen aufgespannt werden, in dem die Aufgabe durchgeführt werden soll. Für die Module Kalender und Verlauf werden diese Informationen benötigt, um die Aufgabe zeitlich einzuordnen. ➓ Im Feld geschätzter Aufwand kann der zu erwartende Aufwand in Stunden zur Durchführung der Aufgabe dokumentiert werden. ⓫ Im Feld % erledigt kann der Umsetzungsgrad der Maßnahme mitgeführt werden. Hierfür steht eine zehn-stufige Skala zur Verfügung. ⓬ Jedem Aufgabentyp können eigene Felder zugeordnet werden. Diese dienen der Dokumentation von aufgabenspezifischen Informationen. So wird in dem oben dargestellten Screenshot das Ergebnis der Wirksamkeitsprüfung dokumentiert. Die Felder lassen sich im Rahmen der Administration an die Organisation anpassen. ⓭ Es können Dateien an eine Aufgabe angehängt werden. Mit dem Button Durchsuchen wird der Dateimanager des Anwenderrechners geöffnet, in dem eine oder mehrere Dateien ausgewählt werden können. Jeder Datei kann eine Beschreibung zugeordnet werden. Die maximale Größe einer Datei ist dabei im Standard auf 5 MB begrenzt. Die Dateigröße ist durch den Administrator anpassbar. ⓮ Der Bereich Dokumente ist nur verfügbar, wenn das Modul DMS (Dokumentenmanagement) aktiviert wurde. An dieser Stelle des Formulars können Dokumente eingebunden werden. Diese werden entweder hochgeladen und im DMS gespeichert oder sie werden, wenn schon im DMS abgelegt, mit der Aufgabe verknüpft. Somit besteht die Möglichkeit Dokumente, die aufgabenübergreifend benötigt werden und daher zentral zu dokumentieren sind, direkt über eine Aufgabe zu erfassen. ⓯ Beobachter sind Mitglieder des Objekts, die über Änderungen in der Aufgabe per E-Mail informiert werden. Über die Kontrollkästchen werden die Personen festgelegt, die diese Aufgabe beobachten sollen. ⓰ Mit dem Attribut Privat kann der Anwender eine Aufgabe erstellen, die nur von ihm selbst und berechtigten Anwendern (z.B. Administratoren) gelesen werden kann. ⓱ Mit dem Button Anlegen oder Anlegen und weiter wird die Erfassung der neuen Aufgabe abgeschlossen. Dafür müssen mindestens die Pflichtfelder gefüllt sein. Wird der Prozess über Anlegen abgeschlossen, so wird die Erfassung beendet und die Ansicht wechselt auf die Aufgabenübersichtsseite. Wird der Prozess mit dem Button Anlegen und weiter abgeschlossen, so wird eine neues Aufgabenformular geöffnet und ein weitere Aufgabe kann erfasst werden. Ruft man eine Aufgabe auf, so öffnet sich folgendes Formular: Im Formular werden alle Informationen zur Aufgabe dargestellt. Es handelt sich konkret um folgende Informationen: ➊ Jede Aufgabe erhält automatisch eine eindeutige Aufgaben ID. Diese wird für die eindeutige Identifizierung der Aufgabe verwendet. Die ID kommt insbesondere bei der Verknüpfung von Aufgaben zum Einsatz. ➋ Zum Aufgabenname werden zusätzlich der Autor, die Zeiten der Erfassung und der letzten Aktualisierung dargestellt. ➌ Unterhalb des Aufgabennamens wird der aktuelle Status der Aufgabe angezeigt. Neben dem Aufgabenstatus sind die Priorität, die zugewiesene Person/Gruppe, die zeitlichen Vorgaben sowie der Erledigungsgrad typische Felder, die zur Standardkonfiguration eines Aufgabentyps gehören. ➍ Die Beschreibung der Aufgabe kann mit Hilfe des integrierten Editors formatiert werden. Mit dem Element Zitieren , oben rechts vom Beschreibungsfeld, wird die Kommentarfunktion der Aufgabe aufgerufen, mit der Beschreibung als Zitat vorangestellt. ➎ In dem Bereich Dateien werden die der Aufgabe angehängten Dateien gelistet. Die Dateien können heruntergeladen , gelöscht oder die Dateibeschreibung geändert werden. ➏ Im Bereich Unteraufgaben werden, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die der Aufgabe unterlagerten Aufgaben mit ihrem Status angezeigt. Durch den Link Hinzufügen kann eine neue Unteraufgabe hinzugefügt werden. Es erscheint die Maske für eine neue Aufgabe, in der das Attribut Übergeordnete Aufgabe bereits vorbelegt ist. Eine neue oder bestehende Aufgabe kann auch durch Zuordnung der übergeordneten Aufgabe im Feld Übergeordnete Aufgabe dieser Aufgabe als Unteraufgabe zugeordnet werden. Ist eine Aufgabe eine Unteraufgabe, so wird die übergeordnete Aufgabe, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, oberhalb des Aufgabennamens dargestellt und verlinkt. In dem Bereich Unteraufgaben kann man durch Anklicken der Aufgaben ID der Unteraufgabe in ihre Einzelansicht springen. Man kann aber auch die Unteraufgabe direkt bearbeiten. Durch Klicken auf das Symbol kann die Verbindung zur Unteraufgabe gelöst werden. Durch das 3-Punkte-Menü kann der Status der Unteraufgabe direkt verändert werden. Das Menü hat folgendes Aussehen: Wie zu erkennen, kann man einerseits in die Bearbeitungsmaske der Unteraufgabe springen, aber auch die wichtigsten Felder direkt verändern. Selbst das Erstellen einer Unteraufgabe zur Unteraufgabe ist möglich, wie das Kopieren als auch das Löschen. In der Systemadministration kann festgelegt werden, dass der Status der Unteraufgaben den Status der übergeordneten Aufgabe bestimmt. Somit werden die Status als auch der % erledigt auf den Status der übergeordneten Aufgabe übertragen. ➐ Zugehörige Aufgaben ermöglichen es dem Anwender, eine Aufgabe mit anderen Aufgaben zu verknüpfen, um Duplikate zu vermeiden oder die Arbeitsabläufe zu vereinfachen. Die zugeordneten Aufgaben werden, wie im Bild zu sehen, mit ihrer Art der Beziehung und dem Status aufgelistet. Entsprechend den Bedienmöglichkeiten der Unteraufgaben läßt sich durch Klicken auf das Symbol die Verbindung aufheben und durch die Auswahl im 3-Punkte-Menü die zugehörige Aufgabe bearbeiten. Durch Klicken auf hinzufügen lassen sich Aufgaben hinzufügen. Es erscheint folgende Auswahl: Es lassen sich verschieden Arten der Beziehungen darstellen. Beziehung mit Es wird nur ein Link zu einer anderen Aufgabe hergestellt Duplikat von / Dupliziert durch Ein Duplikat verbindet die Aufgaben in der Weise, dass beim Schließen der Aufgabe ein Duplikat von mit gelöscht wurde. Ist die Aufgabe dagegen Dupliziert durch eine zugeordneten Aufgabe so wird die Aufgabe gelöscht, sobald die zugeordnete Aufgabe geschlossen wird, aber nicht umgekehrt. Blockiert / Blockiert durch Blockiert eine zugeordnete Aufgabe so lange davor geschlossen zu werden, bis die aktuelle Aufgabe geschlossen ist bzw. das Schließen der Aufgabe wird Blockiert durch die zugehörige Aufgabe. Vorgänger von / Nachfolger von Die zugeordnete Aufgabe ist Vorgänger von oder Nachfolger von. Durch diese Verknüpfung lassen sich Aufgaben in eine zeitliche Abfolge bringen. Dieses führt dazu, dass Zeitverschiebungen in der Ablaufkette sich auf die nachfolgenden Aufgaben auswirken. Kopiert nach / Kopiert von Stellt die Verbindung zwischen den Aufgaben her, die durch die Kopierfunktion angelegt wurden, bzw. die Vorlage für die Aufgabe sind. ➑ Alle Änderungen und Kommentierungen zur Aufgabe können, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, abgerufen werden. Es werden 3 Reiter angezeigt, Historie, Notizen und Eigenschaftsänderungen. Beim Anzeigen einer Aufgabe wird im Standard der Reiter Notiz aufgeblendet. In diesem Reiter werden eingefügte Kommentare dargestellt. Im Reiter Eigenschaftsänderungen werden dagegen alle Änderungen im Bereich des Aufgabenstatus, der Aufgabenbeschreibung und der Verknüpfungen dargestellt. Im Reiter Historie werden alle Änderungen chronologisch ungefiltert aufgelistet. ➒ Über den Button gelangt man in den Bearbeitungsmodus der Aufgabe. In diesem Bereich lassen sich die Attribute der Aufgabe anpassen. Bei der Bearbeitung der Aufgabe besteht die Möglichkeit Kommentare zu erstellen. Hierzu steht die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. Der Kommentar kann als Privat gekennzeichnet werden, so dass der Kommentar nur von dem Ersteller und berechtigten Nutzern (z.B. Admin) gelesen werden kann. ➓ Beobachter einer Aufgabe werden per E-Mail über Änderungen der Aufgabe informiert. Über den Button kann sich der Nutzer auf die Beobachterliste setzen bzw. mit dem Klick auf den Button die Beobachtung wieder einstellen. ⓫ Soll eine Aufgabe gleich oder ähnlich noch einmal durchgeführt werden, so kann die Aufgabe mit ihrer Konfiguration durch Betätigen des Buttons kopiert werden. Es erscheint das Formular, in dem die Grundeinstellungen von der Quellaufgabe übernommen wurden. In der Administration kann festgelegt werden, dass die kopierte Aufgabe mit der Quellaufgabe beim Kopiervorgang automatisch verknüpft wird. ⓬ Das 3-Punkte-Menü beinhaltet zwei Funktionen. Zum einen Link kopieren mit dem der Aufgabenlink in andere Anwendungen kopiert werden kann. Zum Anderen besteht die Auswahl, die Aufgabe zu löschen. ⓭ Die Aufgabe kann zum einen durch Klicken des Button als Atom-xml exportiert werden, um die Aufgabe in andere Systeme zu importieren. Zum Anderen kann mit Klicken des Buttons ein PDF erstellt werden, um die Informationen der Aufgabe außerhalb des Systems zu nutzen. In der Objektkonfiguration können einige Punkte für die Aufgaben in dem Objekt eingestellt werden. Dieses geschieht in der Objektkonfiguration in dem Reiter Aufgaben, in dem folgende Auswahlmöglichkeiten bestehen. Für die Aufgaben in dem Objekt kann die Auswahl der Aufgabentypen im Bereich Aufgabentyp eingeschränkt werden, es können die in den Aufgaben zur Verfügung stehenden Eigenen Felder eingeschränkt werden und es können das Standard-Paket und der Standardbearbeiter, die bei neuen Aufgaben dann automatisch gesetzt werden, definiert bzw. geändert werden. Änderungen müssen mit dem Button übernommen werden. Für die Strukturierung von Aufgaben stehen in dem Modul Aufgaben zwei Funktionen zur Verfügung. Die Aufgabenkategorien dienen im wesentlichen einer feineren Typisierung der Aufgabe und bietet damit einen Weg der automatisierten Aufgabenzuordnung. Die Aufgabenpakte fassen Aufgaben zusammen, die zu einem übergeordneten Thema gehören. Die Pakete können dabei auch objektübergreifend genutzt werden. Aufgabenkategorien müssen beim Anlegen des Objekts in der Konfiguration erstellt werden. Wird in der Objektkonfiguration der Reiter Aufgaben-Kategorien ausgewählt erscheint, wie unten zu sehen, die Übersichtsseite für die Aufgabenkategorie. In diesem Beispiel wurden bereits vier Kategorien angelegt. Jede Kategorie hat einen Namen und kann einem Mitglied oder einer Gruppe zugeordnet werden. Wenn die Kategorie einer neuen Aufgabe zugeordnet wird, wird die Aufgabe dem Mitglied bzw. der Gruppe zugewiesen, die in der Kategorie definiert wurde. Eine neue Kategorie kann durch Klicken des Buttons erstellt werden. Eine bestehende Kategorie kann über den Button bearbeitet werden. In beiden Varianten wird folgende Maske aufgeblendet. Der Name ist dabei ein Pflichtfeld, die Zuweisung optional. Durch den Button wird die Kategorie übernommen. Eine bestehende Kategorie wird über den Button in der Kategoriezeile gelöscht. Wenn die Kategorie bereits genutzt wird, erscheint folgende Maske: Hier kann der Anwender auswählen, ob in den Aufgaben mit der zu löschenden Kategorie entweder die Kategorie gelöscht wird oder eine andere Kategorie gesetzt werden soll. Über den Button kann der gewählte Prozess gestartet werden. Über den Button wird der Löschvorgang abgebrochen. Aufgabenpakete geben die Möglichkeit Aufgaben zu einem übergeordneten Thema zusammenzufassen. Das können z.B. Projekte oder Jahrgänge sein. Diese Zusammenfassung der Pakete in einem Objekt wird als Stapel dargestellt. Sobald ein Paket für ein Objekt zur Verfügung steht, wird im Objektmenü, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, der Reiter Stapel angezeigt. Wird der Reiter ausgewählt so werden die zur Verfügung stehenden Pakete mit den zugewiesenen Aufgaben aufgelistet. Neben dem Paketnamen ➊ wird der Status des Pakets ➋ und unterhalb (falls gepflegt) ein Umsetzungsende mit der verbleibenden Zeit ➌ dargestellt. Der Umsetzungsgrad ➍ (Fortschrittsbalken) des Pakets ermittelt sich automatisch aus den Umsetzungsgraden der zugeordneten Aufgaben. Unterhalb dieser Paketinformationen werden die dem Paket zugeordneten Aufgaben ➎ gelistet und durch Klick auf eine Aufgabe kann diese geöffnet werden. Über das 3-Punkte-Menü in der Aufgabenzeile können auch direkt die Aufgabeneigenschaften angepasst werden, die Aufgabe bearbeitet , gelöscht , kopiert , beobachtet oder eine Unteraufgabe hinzugefügt werden. Ein neues Paket kann über den Button ➐ Neues Paket erstellt werden. Es wird eine Erfassungsmaske eingeblendet. Eine Beschreibung ist im Abschnitt [Neues Paket]. Aufgabenpakete werden in der Konfiguration eines Objekts konfiguriert. In der Objektkonfiguration gelangt man über den Reiter Pakete in der Liste der in diesem Objekt erstellten Pakete. In der Liste der Pakete werden beim Öffnen die Pakete mit dem Status offen angezeigt. Der Filter kann für die Suche nach gesperrten oder abgeschlossen Pakete angepasst werden. Neues Paket Ein neues Paket kann über den Button ➐ Neues Paket erstellt werden. Hier wird die folgende Erfassungsmaske für ein Paket aufgerufen. Als Pflichtfeld muss ein Name vergeben werden. Weiter kann eine Beschreibung und wenn es im Wiki weiter Informationen gibt ein Link zur Wiki-Seite eingefügt werden. Das Datum gibt an, wann das Paket abgeschlossen sein soll. Die gemeinsame Verwendung gibt an, in welchen Objekten das erstellte Paket noch zur Verfügung steht. Zur Auswahl stehen folgende Einträge: Nicht gemeinsam verwenden Das Paket steht nur in dem Objekt zur Auswahl, in dem es erstellt wurde. Mit Unterobjekten Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit Objekthierarchie Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten sowie den übergeordneten Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit Objektbaum Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten, den übergeordneten Objekten sowie den von den übergeordneten Objekten abzweigenden Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit allen Objekten Das Paket steht in allen Objekten zur Auswahl. Mit der Auswahl Standard-Paket kann festgelegt werden, dass bei einer neuen Aufgabe automatisch dieses Paket gesetzt wird. Mit dem Button wird das Paket gespeichert. Paket bearbeiten Über den Button in der Paketzeile kann das Paket bearbeitet werden. Es erscheint folgendes Formular, das in Großteilen dem Formular bei der Erstellung eines Pakets entspricht. Neu ist das Feld Status. Das Paket kann folgende Status annehmen: offen Das Paket kann für Aufgaben ausgewählt werden und wird im Stapel angezeigt. gesperrt Das Paket steht in Aufgaben nicht mehr zur Verfügung wird aber im Stapel angezeigt. abgeschlossen Das Paket steht in Aufgaben nicht zur Verfügung und wird nicht im Stapel angezeigt. Im Stapel können auch abgeschlossenen Pakete angezeigt werden, in dem über den Filter (wird über das Symbol am linken Bildschirmrand eingeblendet) geschlossene Pakete hinzugefügt werden. In der Bearbeitung von Objekten fehlt die Möglichkeit, das Paket als Standardpaket zu deklarieren. Dieses ist nach der Erstellung nur noch über die Aufgabenkonfiguration des Objekts möglich. Paket löschen Über den Button wird das Paket gelöscht und steht nicht weiter zur Verfügung. Das Löschen ist nur möglich, wenn keine Aufgabe mit dem Paket verbunden ist. Ist das der Fall, wird der Löschvorgang mit folgender Meldung abgebrochen. Vollständige Pakete schließen Mit dem Button werden alle Pakete, bei denen alle zugeordneten Aufgaben abgeschlossen sind, auf den Status abgeschlossen gesetzt. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgaben zu importieren. Der Import-Prozess kann in die Aufgabenübersicht und dort über die Auswahl im 3-Punkte-Menü gestartet werden. Formatvorgaben für die Importdatei Die zu importierenden Aufgaben müssen im CSV-Format vorliegen. In der ersten Zeile müssen die Attributbezeichnungen als Überschriften vorliegen. Die Attributbezeichnungen müssen nicht gleich denen im xmera Omnia sein. Bei Namensgleichheit können die Felder aber durch den Importmechanismus automatisch zugeordnet werden, so dass sich der Importvorgang vereinfacht. Es müssen in der Importdatei zumindest die Pflichtfelder vorhanden sein. Falls Attribute nicht vorhanden sind, bleiben diese Felder leer. In den Zeilen darunter sind zu importierenden Aufgaben mit den Attributwerten. Als Vorlage bietet sich ein Export von bereits erfassten Aufgaben an. Diese Datei kann dann als Vorlage für die zu importierenden Dateien dienen. Importprozess Der Importprozess startet mit der Auswahl der Importdatei. Über den Button Durchsuchen…​ kann die Importdatei über den Dateiexplorer ausgewählt werden. Durch wird der nächste Schritt aufgerufen. Jetzt werden die CSV-Optionen abgefragt. Hier geht es um die Trennzeichen, Textqualifizierer, Kodierung, Datumsformat und die Auswahlmöglichkeit, E-Mails für die importierten Aufgaben zu versenden. Im Regelfall ist die Kodierung anzupassen, da diese im Standard nicht UTF-8 ist, die im deutschen Raum üblich ist. Durch wird der nächste Schritt aufgerufen. In diesem Schritt erfolgt die Zuordnung der Aufgabenattribute zu den CSV-Attributen. Dieses erfolgt in der folgenden Maske: In dem Bereich Zuordnung der Felder wird in dem ersten Attribut festgelegt, in welche Objekt die Aufgaben importiert werden sollen. Danach folgen alle möglichen Attribute aufgelistet, die in Aufgaben vergeben werden können. Zu jedem Attribut, kann jetzt ein Feld aus der CSV-Datei zugeordnet werden. Alle erkannten Felder der CSV-Datei können über das Auswahlmenü zugeordnet werden. Als Orientierung ist im unteren Bereich eine Inhaltsvorschau, in der die erkannten Felder (Überschriften) und der Inhalt der ersten Aufgabe dargestellt werden. So weit möglich ordnet der Importprozess Felder bereits den Attributen imn xmera Omnia zu. In der Importdatei ist zu beachten, dass je nach gewähltem Aufgabentyp nicht alle Eigenen Felder zur Verfügung stehen. Sind im Aufgabenimport auch Verknüpfungen zwischen den importierten Aufgaben abgebildet, so sind die Zuordnungen im Bereich Zuweisung von Beziehungen zu pflegen. Mit dem Button gelangt man wieder zu den CSV-Optionen. Mit wird der Import gestartet. Importbericht Zum Abschluss des Importprozesses wird ein Importbericht dargestellt, in dem die Anzahl der importierten Aufgaben oder wie im folgenden Beispiel auf ein Importproblem hingewiesen wird.","title":"Aufgaben","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"aufgaben","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/anwenderhandbuch/aufgaben.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktion Aufgaben","hash":"_funktion_aufgaben","id":1},{"text":"Aufgabenübersicht","hash":"_aufgabenübersicht","id":2},{"text":"Aufgabenliste","hash":"_aufgabenliste","id":3},{"text":"Seitennavigation","hash":"_seitennavigation","id":4},{"text":"Filter","hash":"_filter","id":5},{"text":"Abfrage","hash":"_abfrage","id":6},{"text":"Neue Aufgabe","hash":"_neue_aufgabe","id":7},{"text":"Weitere Funktionen im 3-Punkte-Menü","hash":"_weitere_funktionen_im_3_punkte_menü","id":8},{"text":"Aufgabenexport","hash":"_aufgabenexport","id":9},{"text":"Aufgaben anlegen","hash":"_aufgaben_anlegen","id":10},{"text":"Objekt","hash":"_objekt","id":11},{"text":"Aufgabentyp","hash":"_aufgabentyp","id":12},{"text":"Thema","hash":"_thema","id":13},{"text":"Beschreibung","hash":"_beschreibung","id":14},{"text":"Status","hash":"_status","id":15},{"text":"Priorität","hash":"_priorität","id":16},{"text":"Zugewiesen an","hash":"_zugewiesen_an","id":17},{"text":"Übergeordnete Aufgabe","hash":"übergeordnete_aufgabe","id":18},{"text":"Beginn und Abgabedatum","hash":"_beginn_und_abgabedatum","id":19},{"text":"Geschätzter Aufwand","hash":"_geschätzter_aufwand","id":20},{"text":"% erledigt","hash":"_erledigt","id":21},{"text":"Eigene Felder","hash":"_eigene_felder","id":22},{"text":"Dateien (hochladen)","hash":"_dateien_hochladen","id":23},{"text":"Dokumente (DMS)","hash":"_dokumente_dms","id":24},{"text":"Beobachter","hash":"_beobachter","id":25},{"text":"Privat","hash":"_privat","id":26},{"text":"Anlegen / Anlegen und weiter","hash":"_anlegen_anlegen_und_weiter","id":27},{"text":"Aufgaben bearbeiten","hash":"_aufgaben_bearbeiten","id":28},{"text":"Aufgaben-ID","hash":"_aufgaben_id","id":29},{"text":"Aufgabenname","hash":"_aufgabenname","id":30},{"text":"Statusinformationen","hash":"_statusinformationen","id":31},{"text":"Aufgabenbeschreibung","hash":"_aufgabenbeschreibung","id":32},{"text":"Dateien","hash":"_dateien","id":33},{"text":"Unteraufgaben","hash":"unteraufgabe","id":34},{"text":"Zugehörige Aufgaben","hash":"_zugehörige_aufgaben","id":35},{"text":"Änderungsverfolgung und Kommentierung","hash":"_änderungsverfolgung_und_kommentierung","id":36},{"text":"Aufgabe bearbeiten","hash":"_aufgabe_bearbeiten","id":37},{"text":"Aufgabe beobachten","hash":"_aufgabe_beobachten","id":38},{"text":"Aufgabe kopieren","hash":"_aufgabe_kopieren","id":39},{"text":"3-Punkte-Menü","hash":"_3_punkte_menü","id":40},{"text":"Aufgabe abrufen","hash":"_aufgabe_abrufen","id":41},{"text":"Aufgaben konfigurieren","hash":"_aufgaben_konfigurieren","id":42},{"text":"Aufgaben strukturieren","hash":"_aufgaben_strukturieren","id":43},{"text":"Aufgabenkategorien","hash":"_aufgabenkategorien","id":44},{"text":"Aufgabenpakte","hash":"_aufgabenpakte","id":45},{"text":"Übersicht Aufgabenpakete","hash":"_übersicht_aufgabenpakete","id":46},{"text":"Aufgabenpakete verwalten","hash":"_aufgabenpakete_verwalten","id":47},{"text":"Aufgaben importieren","hash":"_aufgaben_importieren","id":48}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"Wenn es keine öffentlichen Inhalte gibt, wird der Nutzer automatisch auf die Login-Seite geleitet. Ist die Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung aktiviert, erscheint anschließend die Abfrage nach dem Code. Anschließend wird die Hauptseite von xmera Omnia angezeigt. Diese beinhaltet das System Dashboard.

Objektmenü Das Objektmenü wird ausschließlich in Objektseiten angezeigt und bietet Zugriff auf die aktivierten Objektmodule. Im oberen rechten Bereich der Seite, unterhalb des Nutzermenüs, befindet sich ein Such- und Schnellnavigationsbereich. Damit wird der Zugriff auf die zuletzt besuchten Objekte erleichtert und eine Suche über alle Objekte und deren Inhalte ermöglicht. Über diesen Bereich ist eine direkte Navigation zu den gewünschten Objekten möglich. Schnellnavigation Wird, wie im Bild oben zu sehen, das Drop-Down-Menü durch Klick auf Zu einem Objekt springen geöffnet, so werden eine Suchzeile, in der nach Objekten gesucht werden kann, und die kürzlich verwendeten Objekte angezeigt. Suche In dem Suchfenster kann ein Text eingegeben werden, nach dem in allen Objekten und den darin enthaltenen Informationen gesucht wird. Die Suche beginnt nach dem die Eingabe bestätigt wurde. Danach werden die Suchergebnisse angezeigt. Im oberen Bereich (grau hinterlegt) kann die Suche weiter eingeschränkt oder der Suchtext angepasst werden. Die Suche wird, wenn diese aus einem Objekt aufgerufen wird, auf das Objekt mit seinen Unterobjekten eingegrenzt. Unterhalb des grauen Bereichs sind die Suchergebnisse aufgeführt. Wird in das Suchfeld die ID einer Aufgabe (Sicherheitsanforderungen, Risikobewertungen, Maßnahmen, …​) eingegeben, so bekommt der Nutzer diese Aufgabe direkt als Einzelansicht angezeigt. Der Inhaltsbereich kann in xmera Omnia auf eine feste Breite begrenzt werden, wodurch das Lesen von Texten angenehmer wird. Im nachfolgenden Bild ist der Inhaltsbereich entsprechend begrenzt, was die gelben Flächen verdeutlichen sollen. Diese Breite ist auf den meisten Seiten der Standard. Der gelb markierte Randbereich rechts und links wird je nach Größe des Browserfensters automatisch angepasst. Bei Bedarf kann der selbe Inhalt auch über die gesamte Seitenbreite angezeigt werden. Durch einen Klick auf das rote Plus-Symbol (rot umrandet im Bild oben) kann der Inhaltsbereich vergrößert werden. Das folgende Beispiel zeigt die gesamte Seitenbreite.

Das untere Bild zeigt den Filterbereich (grün umrandet) sowie weitere Optionen zum Gruppieren und zur Auswahl von Tabellenspalten (magenta umrandet) am Beispiel der Sicherheitsanforderungen. Auf diese Weise können individuelle Listen durch Abfragen (blau) gestaltet werden. So erhalten Nutzer verschiedenste Sichten auf die umfangreiche Datenbasis des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS) und damit einen schnellen Überblick. Über den Button wird der Filter wieder auf die Standard-Liste zurückgesetzt. Mit der xmera Omnia Philosophie \"Alle Assets sind Objekte und jede Maßnahme / Handlung ist eine Aufgabe\" läßt sich mit den Objekt- und Aufgabenlisten ein ISMS effizient gestalten. Objektliste Die Objektliste zeigt alle Objekte des Systems. Sie ist über das Topmenü erreichbar. Objekte werden in der Standardansicht entweder als Karten oder in Tabellenform angezeigt. Die Standardansicht wird im Administrationsbereich angepasst. Aufgabenliste Die Aufgabenliste listet alle Aufgaben des Objekts, in dem diese aufgerufen wurde, sowie die Aufgaben der unterlagerten Objekte. Dabei werden in der Standardliste nur die offenen Aufgaben angezeigt. Der Filterbereich einer Liste kann durch den Pfeil ausgeklappt und wieder eingeklappt werden. In den Zeilen des Filterbereichs werden die aktuell gewählten Einstellungen angezeigt. Die 1. Spalte (magenta) zeigt an, ob der Filter in der Zeile aktiv ist. Die 2. Spalte (grün) zeigt die Filterattribute. Die 3. Spalte (blau) zeigt die Filterregel an. Die 4. Spalte (rot) zeigt den Filterwert. Wie zu erkennen ist, ist der Aufbau einer Zeile an den Attributtyp angepasst. Auch der zur Verfügung stehende Regelsatz ist spezifisch für jeden Attributtyp. Im folgenden Beispiel ist der Regelsatz für ein Datum dargestellt. Die ausgewählten Regeln werden durch Klick auf den Button angewendet. Filter hinzufügen Im rechten oberen Bereich des Filterbereichs befindet sich das Auswahlfeld für Filter hinzufügen. Über das Auswahlfeld werden die zur Verfügung stehenden Attribute angezeigt.

Wird keine neue Datei hochgeladen, so wird die Datei der letzten gültigen Version weiter verwendet. Wird eine neue Datei hochgeladen, wird diese Datei der Version zugeordnet. Mit dem Klick auf den Button wird die Version angelegt. Im DMS können auch Verknüpfungen erstellt werden. Eine Verknüpfung kann im 3-Punkte-Menü über den Menüpunkt Verknüpfung anlegen angelegt werden. Es erscheint folgende Maske: Dabei wird zwischen internen und externen Verknüpfungen unterschieden. Interne Verknüpfungen zeigen auf Dateien, die in anderen Objekten abgelegt wurden. Entsprechend ist in diesem Fall das Quellobjekt und die Quelldatei zu wählen. Quellordner und Name werden automatisch übernommen. Externe Verknüpfungen sind Verbindungen zu externen Servern, die über eine URL erreicht werden können. Entsprechend ändert sich die Maske bei der Auswahl Extern wie folgt. Hier können die URL und der Name der Datei gepflegt werden. Durch Klicken auf den Button wird die Verknüpfung in der DMS-Dateiliste angezeigt. xmera Omnia bietet den Benutzern die Möglichkeit sich über Änderungen in Ordnern per Mail informieren zu lassen. Diese Funktion kann über das 3-Punkte-Menü mit Benachrichtigung ein und Benachrichtigung aus gesteuert werden. Die E-Mail wird an die im Benutzerprofil angegebene E-Mailadresse versand. Ein Löschen von Dokumenten ist aus der Dokumentenliste möglich. In der Dokumentenleiste kann, bei entsprechender Berechtigung über den Button das Dokument gelöscht werden. Wird über das 3-Punkte-Menü die Bearbeitung aufgerufen, kann eine Version gelöscht werden. Das Löschen erreicht man über das 3-Punkte-Menü neben der Version. Wurde ein Dokument über einen Genehmigungs-Workflow freigegeben, so kann das Dokument nicht gelöscht werden. Hier besteht nur die Möglichkeit die Version zu sperren. Ein Dokument, bei dem aktuell der Freigabeprozess läuft, kann weder gelöscht noch gesperrt werden. Mit dem Sperren von Dokumenten wird verhindert, dass eine Datei bearbeitet werden kann. Das Sperren erfolgt entweder über die Auswahl oder über den gleich bezeichneten Button im oberen rechten Bereich der Bearbeitungsmaske des Dokuments. Ist ein Dokument gesperrt, so wird im Datumsfeld das Symbol angehängt und die Buttons für das Sperren werden zum Button . Über die Button kann das Dokument wieder entsperrt werden. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit in der Administration eigene Felder zu jedem Dokument hinzuzufügen. Zum Beispiel sind es hier, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die Vertraulichkeitsklasse und der Bearbeitungsstatus. Diese eigenen Felder ermöglichen weitere Klassifizierungs- und Strukturierungsmöglichkeiten, nach denen in der Dokumentenliste auch gefiltert / gruppiert werden kann. Durch eine Ordnerstruktur lassen sich die Dokumente in der Dokumentenliste strukturieren. Im DMS lassen sich in jedem Ordner Berechtigungen vergeben, die es ermöglichen, einzelne Ordner nur einer eingegrenzten Nutzergruppe zugänglich zu machen. Angelegt werden Ordner über Klicken des Buttons . Es erscheint folgende Erfassungsmaske: Neben dem Datum kann eine Beschreibung, sowie weiter individuelle Einträge (eigenen Felder) dem Ordner zugeordnet werden. Weiter können die Zugriffe auf den Ordner durch die Auswahlfelder im Bereich Zugriff erlaubt für eingeschränkt werden. Sind keine Haken gesetzt, wird die Zugriff durch die Rollenberechtigungen bestimmt. Die Berechtigung kann durch Auswahl einzelner Rollen oder Benutzer weiter eingeschränkt werden. Benutzer werden zunächst nicht angezeigt. Durch Klicken auf den Button können Benutzer / Gruppen des Objekts hinzugefügt werden. Durch Klicken auf den Ordnernamen in der Dokumentenliste gelangt man in die Liste des Ordners. Angezeigt wird der aktuelle Ordner in der Zeile unterhalb des Objektmenüs. In dem Beispiel oben ist es Dateien / Protokolle / Lenkungskreis. Durch Klicken auf den Ordnernamen in der Ordnerstruktur kann man direkt in die Dokumentenliste des entsprechenden Ordners springen. Neue Dokumente werden immer dem Ordner zugeordnet, von dem aus eine neue Datei hinzugefügt wird. Eine Datei, aber auch ein ganzer Ordner lassen sich im Nachgang auch verschieben oder kopieren. Im 3-Punkte-Menu in der Zeile des Ordner oder der Datei, die verschoben werden soll, wählt man den Button . Es erscheint folgende Maske: In der Maske kann das Zielobjekt und der Zielordner gewählt werden, in das das Dokument/Ordner verschoben bzw. kopiert werden soll. Die Auswahl, ob es sich um eine Kopie oder ob es ich um ein Verschieben handelt, wird durch Klicken auf den Button oder festgelegt. Ein Ordner kann mit der Funktion im 3-Punkte-Menu in der Zeile des Ordners, der gelöscht werden soll, durchgeführt werden. Mit dem Genehmigungs-Workflow bietet xmera Omnia die Möglichkeit Genehmigungsprozesse für Dokumente abzubilden. Hierzu wird ein Workflow festgelegt, in welchen Schritten die Genehmigung zu erfolgen hat der Workflow einem Dokument zugeordnet, der Freigabeprozess gestartet und die Freigabe im Dokument gespeichert. Diese Schritte werden im Folgenden beschrieben. Grundsätzlich werden globale und lokale Workflows unterschieden. Globale Workflows werden im Administrationsbereich von xmera Omnia erstellt und stehen in allen Objekten zur Verfügung. Die lokalen Workflows werden im Konfigurationsbereich des Objekts erstellt und stehen nur dem Objekt zur Verfügung. Die Erstellung eines Workflows ist in beiden Fällen gleich. Die Erstellung und Pflege von lokaler Genehmigungs-Workflows erfolgt in der Objektkonfiguration im Reiter Genehmigungs-Workflow. Hier finden sich die für das Objekt definierten Workflows. Es können über den Button ein neuer Workflow erstellt, durch Klicken auf den Namen des Workflows in der Liste der Workflow bearbeitet werden oder durch Klicken auf der lokale Workflow gelöscht werden. Ein Workflow kann gelöscht werden, obwohl er bereits einem Dokument zugeordnet wurde. Dieses führt zur Fehlern, die nicht über die Anwendung zu reparieren sind. Wird ein neuer Workflow erstellt, so erscheint folgende Maske: Hier wird der Name des Workflows festgelegt und es kann optional als Vorlage ein bestehender Workflow gewählt werden. Mit dem Button oder durch Bearbeiten eines bestehenden Workflows gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsmaske des Workflows. In dieser Maske kann zum einen der Name des Workflows verändert werden und es können die Workflow Schritte bearbeitet werden. Der Ablauf des Workflows erfolgt in Schritten. Es werden die Genehmiger des 1. Schritts zur Genehmigung/Ablehnung aufgefordert werden. Ist dieser Schritt genehmigt, wird der die Genehmiger des folgenden Schritts zur Genehmigung/Ablehnung aufgefordert. Sind alle Schritte genehmigt, so wird das Dokument als genehmigt klassifiziert. Mit dem Button wird eine Maske geöffnet, mit der Objektmitglieder einem neuen oder einem bestehenden Schritt hinzugefügt werden können. Hier müssen als erstes die Mitglieder der Gruppe gewählt werden, die dem Bearbeitungsschritt zugeordnet werden sollen. Als nächstes ist der Schritt zu wählen, dem diese Mitglieder zugeordnet werden sollen. Bei der Erstellung eines neuen Schritts ist der Name des Schritts neben dem Auswahlfeld zu setzen. Mit dem Wählen der Auswahl UND oder ODER wird der Schritt erstellt bzw. geändert. Alle Mitglieder die mit einem UND dem Schritt zugeordnet sind müssen den Schritt genehmigen, damit der Schritt abgeschlossen sind. Alle Mitglieder die mit ODER dem Schritt zugeordnet sind, sind optional. Sind nur Mitglieder mit ODER dem Schritt zugeordnet, muss zur Freigabe des Schritts mindestens ein Mitglied den Schritt freigeben. Über den Button können weitere Schritte hinzugefügt werden. Die Bearbeitung teilt sich in drei Aspekte auf: Neue Mitglieder zu einem Schritt hinzufügen Mitgliederfunktionen ändern oder löschen Reihenfolge der Schritte verändern Neue Mitglieder werden über den Prozess in einen neuen Schritt eingebunden. Der Ablauf entspricht dem Vorgehen beim Erstellen eines neuen Schrittes. Bei dem Hinzufügen wird der Schritt ausgewählt, in dem das Mitglied bzw. die Mitglieder hinzugefügt werden sollen. Soll die Auswahl UND / ODER für ein Mitglied verändert werden oder soll ein Mitglied aus einem Schritt entfernt werden, so geht man über den Button in der Zeile des zu bearbeitenden Schritts. Es öffnet sich die Zeile im Bearbeitungsmodus. Hier kann der Name des Schritts angepasst werden, pro Mitglied die Option UND bzw. ODER verändert werden oder das Mitglied gelöscht werden. Mit dem Button Wechseln wird die Änderung übernommen und mit Abbrechen verworfen. Die Reihenfolge der Schritte kann über eine Drag & Drop Funktion verändert werden. Mit gehaltener linker Maustaste auf das Symbol kann die gewählte Zeile verschoben werden. An der Stelle, an der die Maus gelöst wird, wird der Schritt hin verschoben. Um einen Workflow zu starten, muss der Workflow zunächst dem Dokument zugeordnet werden. Dieses erfolgt über den Punkt Workflow starten im 3-Punkte-Menü der Dokumentenzeile. Es erscheint ein Fenster, in dem der für die Freigabe benötigte Workflow ausgewählt wird. Es ist per Dropdown-Menü ein Workflow auszuwählen. Mit OK wird der gewählte Workflow dem Dokument zugeordnet. Anschließend muss für die Durchführung des Workflowprozess dieser gestartet werden. Hierzu wird wiederum über das 3-Punkte-Menü über den Menüpunkt Start der Prozess gestartet. Der aktuelle Status des Workflowprozesses erscheint durch Klicken auf den Status des Workflows. Es wird die Darstellung des Workflowporzesses mit den einzelnen Schritten angezeigt. Ist der Freigabeprozess gestartet wird allen Mitgliedern des 1. Schritt auf \"Meine Seite\" die offenen Genehmigungsworkflows angezeigt. Weiter wird xmera Omnia auch eine E-Mail an die Freigeber des Schritts gesendet. Eine Freigabe ist im DMS am freizugebenden Dokument möglich. Ein Freigeber erhält im 3-Punkte-Menü in der Dokumentenseite die Auswahl Genehmigt mit der die Freigabe gestartet werden kann. Wird der Freigabeprozess mit dem gestartet wird das Freigabemaske geöffnet. In dieser Maske kann das Dokument genehmigt, abgelehnt (nur mit Begründung) oder an ein anderes Mitglied delegieren. Sind die Freigaben für den 1. Schritt abgeschlossen, so beginnt der Prozess für den Folgeschritt. Dieses wird bis zum letzten Schritt fortgesetzt. Ist der letzte Schritt genehmigt, ist das Dokument genehmigt. Wird ein Workflow Abgelehnt so muss eine neue Version erstellt werden und der Workflow neu gestartet werden.","title":"Dokumentenmanagement (DMS)","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"dokumentenmanagement","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/anwenderhandbuch/dokumentenmanagement.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktionen des Dokumentenmanagements","hash":"_funktionen_des_dokumentenmanagements","id":1},{"text":"Dokumente verwalten","hash":"_dokumente_verwalten","id":2},{"text":"Neues Dokument anlegen","hash":"_neues_dokument_anlegen","id":3},{"text":"Neue Dokumentversion anlegen","hash":"_neue_dokumentversion_anlegen","id":4},{"text":"Interne und externe Dokumentverknüpfungen","hash":"_interne_und_externe_dokumentverknüpfungen","id":5},{"text":"Benachrichtigung über Dokumente","hash":"_benachrichtigung_über_dokumente","id":6},{"text":"Löschen von Dokumenten","hash":"_löschen_von_dokumenten","id":7},{"text":"Löschen von Dokumentversionen","hash":"_löschen_von_dokumentversionen","id":8},{"text":"Sperren von Dokumenten","hash":"_sperren_von_dokumenten","id":9},{"text":"Metadaten","hash":"_metadaten","id":10},{"text":"Ordnerstruktur","hash":"_ordnerstruktur","id":11},{"text":"Ordner anlegen","hash":"_ordner_anlegen","id":12},{"text":"Navigieren","hash":"_navigieren","id":13},{"text":"Ordner und Dokumente verschieben/kopieren","hash":"_ordner_und_dokumente_verschiebenkopieren","id":14},{"text":"Ordner löschen","hash":"_ordner_löschen","id":15},{"text":"Genehmigungs-Workflow","hash":"_genehmigungs_workflow","id":16},{"text":"Workflows erstellen","hash":"_workflows_erstellen","id":17},{"text":"Workflows bearbeiten","hash":"_workflows_bearbeiten","id":18},{"text":"Workflows zuordnen","hash":"_workflows_zuordnen","id":19},{"text":"Workflows freigeben","hash":"_workflows_freigeben","id":20}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"Im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagements ist der Gesprächs- und Diskussionsbedarf innerhalb der Organisation in der Regel recht hoch.

Die Wikigestaltung wird durch die Wiki-Toolbar, mit der die Texte formatiert werden können, und der Möglichkeit Bilder und Grafiken einzubinden, unterstützt. Zum Erstellen von Grafiken muss die Drawio-Integration im Administrationsbereich konfiguriert worden sein. Ist das Modul Wiki für das Objekt aktiviert, so kann das Objekt-Wiki über den Menüpunkt Wiki geöffnet werden. Ist noch keine Wikiseite gespeichert, so wird die erste Seite des neuen Wikis im Bearbeitungsmodus geöffnet. In xmera Omnia wird als Auszeichnungssprache Markdown empfohlen. Markdown ist eine sehr einfache Auszeichnungssprache, die die Textformatierung unterstützt. Über die Administration kann die Anwendung auch auf Textile umgestellt werden. Für die Textformatierung steht eine Toolbar zur Verfügung. Das Ergebnis kann man sich über die Vorschau anschauen. Jede Anpassung kann kommentiert werden. Damit hat man in der Veränderungshistorie des Wiki die Möglichkeit, Änderungen leichter nachzuvollziehen. Mit Klick auf den Button wird die aktuelle Seite gespeichert. Es erscheint die Wiki-Startseite. Die erste erstellte Seite erhält immer den Namen Wiki und ist die Hauptseite (als erstes angezeigte Seite). Der Name, die Festlegung der Hauptseite sowie die Inhalte lassen sich durch Umbenennen und Bearbeiten jederzeit anpassen. Eine weitere Wikiseite wird über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl aufgerufen. Im Dialog Neue Wiki-Seite müssen der Titel und die Übergeordnete Seite festgelegt werden. Anschließend öffnet sich das Bearbeitungsfenster mit der Wiki-Toolbar. Die Umbenennung der Seite, die Änderung der übergeordneten Seite oder die Zuordnung zu einem anderen Objekt erfolgt über den Prozess Seite umbenenen Die Sidebar dient der leichteren Navigation im Wiki. Sie enthält im Standard folgende Elemente: Hauptseite Seiten nach Titel sortiert Seiten nach Datum (der Erstellung) sortiert Mit der Auswahl Seiten nach Titel sortiert oder Seiten nach Datum sortiert werden die erstellten Wikiseiten aufgelistet. Im folgenden Beispiel ist die Sortierung nach Datum zu sehen Die Sidebar kann individuell ergänzt werden. Über den Button im oberen Bereich der Sidebar gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsseite der Sidebar. Die Wikiseite mit dem Namen Sidebar wird, sobald diese vorhanden ist, oberhalb der Standardelemente dargestellt. So lässt sich mit Hilfe von Seitenlinks ein Inhaltsverzeichnis aufbauen. Soll der Aufbau eines Inhaltsverzeichnisses automatisiert erfolgen, bietet sich das Wiki-Makro {{child_pages}} an. Dieses listet alle untergeordenten Seiten automatisch auf. Wird die Seite Sidebar der restlichen Seitenstruktur, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, übergeordnet so lässt sich mit dem folgenden Eintrag in der Seite Sidebar automatisiert die Seitenstruktur anzeigen. Soll das Inhaltsverzeichnis auf die ersten x Ebenen begrenzt werden, so kann dieses über den Zusatz {{child_pages(depth=_x_)}} eingeschränkt werden. Soll diese Untergliederung zur Sidebar nicht erfolgen oder ist die alphabetische Reihenfolge ungünstig, kann die Seite manuell strukturiert werden. Im Folgenden ist ein Beispiel einer manuell angelegten Seitenstruktur zu sehen # Wiki Sidebar (Beispiel) ## [[Testwiki]] {{child_pages(Testwiki)}} ## [[Neuer_Wiki_Baum|Baum 2]] {{child_pages(Neuer_Wiki_Baum)}} Die Sidebar sieht dann in dem Beispiel wie folgt aus: Über das 3-Punkte-Menü auf der Seite gelangt man zur Umbenennungsmaske der Wikiseite. Über diese Maske kann der Seitenname (in der URL) geändert werden, die Seite als Hauptseite (als erste angezeigte Seite) festgelegt werden, bei Namensänderung festlegt werden, dass existierende Links umgeleitet werden, das zugeordnete Objekt geändert werden und eine übergeordnete Seite festgelegt bzw. verändert werden. Mit der Namensänderung wird automatisch der URL-Name geändert. Damit funktionieren ggf. externe Links auf die Wikiseite nicht mehr. Wichtig ist dann, die Option Existierende Links umleiten ausgewählt zu haben. Eine Wiki-Seite kann über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl Löschen gelöscht werden. Nach der Auswahl wird nochmals abgefragt, ob die Seite wirklich gelöscht werden soll. Wird mit OK bestätigt ist die Wikiseite gelöscht.

Die Bearbeitungsseite baut sich wie folgt (von oben nach unten) auf: Name der Wikiseite (rot) Wiki-Toolbar mit dem Bearbeitungsbereich Zuordung Übergeordente Seite Kommentar Dateieanhänge Diese Elemente werden im folgenden beschrieben. Der Name der Wikiseite lässt sich nicht im Bearbeitungsmodus ändern. Die Änderung ist über Seite umbenennen möglich. Die Textbearbeitung erfolgt in diesem Beispiel mit der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown. Grundsätzlich kann in der Administration auch Textile gewählt werden. In beiden Fällen bietet xmera Omnia eine Vorschau und die wichtigsten Formatierungselemente als Toolbar. Somit ist ein schneller Einstieg in die Bearbeitung möglich. Die Umschaltung zwischen dem Bearbeitungsmodus und der Vorschau erfolgt über den Tab . Die Bearbeitung erfolgt über die folgenden Button: Schrift in fett Schrift in kursiv Text unterstrichen Text durchgestrichen Darstellung des Texts als Quelltext ohne Formatierung Überschriften der Ebene 1 bis 3 Aufzählung nummerierte Auflistung Darstellung / Rücknahme eines Zitatbereichs Erstellen eines Tabellenrahmens Darstellung eines Textes in einem gesonderten Feld Abbildung von Code-Elementen mit farblicher Hervorhebung der Syntax Link zu einer anderen Wiki-Seite Einbindung einer Grafik. Einbindung eines Drawio Diagramms Öffnen einer Hilfe für die verwendete Auszeichnungssprache (hier Markdown) Diese Funktionen lassen sich gut über die Vorschau ausprobieren. Das erleichtert die Einarbeitung in die Auszeichnungssprache. Am Ende der Tollbar können weitere Hilfen aufgerufen werden. So erhält der Nutzer weitere Tipps zur Formatierung der Texte und zum Einbinden von Informationen aus dem restlichen System. Einige wichtige Elemente sind für Markdown im Kapitel Syntax Markdown beschrieben. In dem Dropdown-Auswahlfeld kann eine bereits in dem Objekt erstellten Wikiseite als übergeordnete Seite ausgewählt werden. So wird eine Struktur dargestellt, die die Orientierung in den Menüs erleichtert. Das Wiki erstellt automatisch eine Historie der Änderungen. Um Änderungen besser nachvollziehbar zu machen, kann die Änderung mit einem Kommentar ergänzt werden. Hier können Dokumente an die Wikiseite angehängt werden, die dann auf der selben Seite zum Download bereitstehen oder in den Text eingearbeitet werden können. Die maximale Dateigröße wird durch die Administration begrenzt. Im Standard sind dieses 5 MB. Die so hinzugefügte Datei steht im unteren Bereich zur Ansicht bzw. zum Download bereit. Ein Dateianhang kann aber auch ohne den Weg über Seite bearbeiten über den Button an die Seite gehängt werden. An das Wiki angehängte Bilder lassen sich über das Wiki-Makro ![Bildbezeichung](Dateiname) leicht in die Wikiseite einbinden. Bilder, die in der Zwischenablage gespeichert wurden, wie bspw. Screenshots, können direkt per Strg+V in das Textfeld kopiert werden. Um bei Änderungen auf der Wikiseite informiert zu werden, kann der Button zugeschaltet werden. Er wechselt dann auf die Darstellung . Durch einen weiteren Klick auf den Button wird der Beobachtungsmodus wieder ausgeschaltet. Der Modus wirkt sich immer nur auf die eine Wikiseite aus. Alle Änderungen auf der Wikiseite werden in der Historie dokumentiert. Erreicht wird die Historie über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl Historie. Es wird eine Liste der Wiki-Änderungen angezeigt. In der Liste werden das Datum der Änderung, der Autor und der Kommentar gelistet. Über die Auswahlpunkte zu Beginn jeder Zeile können zwei Änderungsschritte ausgewählt werden, die über den Button verglichen werden können. Rot hinterlegt sind gelöschte Passagen und grün hinterlegt sind hinzugefügte Passagen. Durch Klicken auf Annotieren in der Zeile der Veränderung wird die Wikiseite mit den einzelnen Änderungsschritten dargestellt. Jeder Änderungsschritt ist mit seiner Nummer und dem Autor mit einer eigenen Farbe dargestellt.

Wiki-Makros sind vordefinierte Funktionen, die dynamische Inhalte in den Wikitext integrieren können. Eine aktuelle Übersicht über alle verfügbaren Makros erhält der Nutzer mit diesem Befehl: {{macro_list}} In der aktuellen Version von xmera Omnia sind das: Grafiken spielen im Rahmen des ISMS eine wichtige Rolle. Typische Grafiken sind der Netzplan, Prozesslandkarten oder Prozessablaufdiagramme. Hierfür eignet sich die Integration von Drawio besonders gut. Weitere Videos. Um Drawio in xmera Omnia nutzen zu können, muss dass System im Anwendungsbereich entsprechend konfiguriert sein. Bevor mit dem Zeichnen begonnen werden kann, wird eine Standarddatei mit Hilfe der Wiki-Toolbar erstellt. Hierzu muss gelickt werden. Es erscheint folgendes Eingabefenster: Nach Eingabe eines Dateinamen und ggf. Auswahl weiterer Parameter, muss auf Makro einfügen geklickt werden. Das Makro {{drawio_attach(dateiname.png)}} wird angezeigt. Nach dem Speichern erscheint ein Startbutton: Nach dem Doppelklick auf den Startbutton kann mit der Zeichnung begonnen werden. Markdown ist eine Auszeichnungssprache die auch aus dem git-Umdeld bekannt ist. Sie ermöglicht es einen Fließtext durch einfache Ergänzungen in eine formatierte Form zu bringen. Die wichtigsten Hilfen sind über den Button in der Wiki-Toolbar zu erhalten. Es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den wichtigsten Formatierungs- und Verlinkungsmöglichkeiten. Am Ende ist ein Link mit mehr Informationen. Dieser Link öffnet wiederum eine neue Seite mit detaillierteren Beschreibungen.

Das Modul erzeugt automatisch beim Nächsten Lauf eine neue Aufgabe, die die Werte der geplanten Aufgabe enthält und erhöht das Datum für den Nächsten Lauf um das definierte Intervall. Somit wird die Aufgabe zyklisch im Objekt erzeugt. Damit das Modul funktioniert, muss ein CronJob auf dem Server eingerichtet sein, der die Erstellungsroutine startet. Der Zyklus des CronJobs gibt vor, wann ein Lauf zur Erstellung von Aufgaben gestartet wird. Dabei werden dann alle Aufgaben erzeugt, dessen nächster Lauf in der Vergangenheit liegt. Ist das Modul Wiederholende Aufgaben für ein Objekt aktiviert, erscheint das zugehörige Menüelement in der Objektansicht. Mit Klick auf das Menüelement wird, wie im Folgenden zu sehen, die Liste der Wiederholenden Aufgaben gezeigt. Aus der Liste heraus lassen sich einzelne Aufgaben durch Klick auf den Button löschen oder die Wiederholende Aufgabe bearbeiten . In der Listenansicht des Moduls Wiederholende Aufgaben kann durch Klick auf den Button eine leere Bearbeitungsseite für eine neue Wiederholenden Aufgaben aufgerufen werden. Die Felder Thema und Aufgabentyp sind Pflichtfelder. Für die Pflichtfelder Status und Priorität werden bei der Erstellung einer Aufgabe die zugehörigen Standardwerte gesetzt. Damit die periodischen Aufgaben erstellt werden können, müssen der nächste Lauf (Trigger für die erste Erstellung einer Aufgabe) und das Intervall (zur Festlegung des folgenden Triggers) gepflegt sein. Wird der Haken bei Beginn setzen gesetzt, wird das Erstelldatum einer Aufgabe für den Beginn verwendet. Andernfalls bleibt das Feld Beginn leer.

Eine ihrer Hauptaufgabe ist die Bereitstellung des Assetsregisters im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS). Objekte zeichnen sich durch folgende Eigenschaften aus: Objekte können hierarchisch strukturiert werden, Objekten können Mitglieder mit Rollen zugeordnet werden, Objekte können Funktionsmodule bereitstellen, Objekte gehören einer Objektklasse an, Objekte können mit anderen Objekten logisch verknüpft werden. Die Übersicht der Objekte wird im Topmenü über den Menüpunkt Objekte aufgerufen. Jeder Anwender sieht die öffentlichen Objekte und die Objekte, in denen er eine Rolle zugewiesen bekommen hat. Die Objektdaten werden in der Objektübersicht dargestellt (siehe Kasten 3 im nachfolgenden Bild): ➊ Objektbezeichung (Hierarchiepfad und Objektname) ➋ Objektbeschreibung ➌ Spezifische Objektdaten (Eigene Felder) ➍ Aufgaben ➎ Mitglieder des Objekts mit ihren Rollen ➏ Unterobjekte (Hierarchie) ➐ Verknüpfte Objekte (logische Zusammenhänge) Die Objekthierarchie bietet die Möglichkeit Arbeitsbereiche, Verantwortlichkeiten/Organisationen als auch Sicherheitszonen/Cluster strukturiert darzustellen. Die hierarchische Struktur wird durch die Festlegung des übergeordneten Objekts bei der Erstellung/Konfiguration des Objekts definiert. So entsteht ein Objektbaum, der sich in der Listenanzeige der Objektübersicht darstellen läßt. In der Objektübersicht wird die Struktur in der Objektbezeichung, wie im nachfolgenden Bild an Pkt. ➊ zu sehen, mit den Links zu den übergeordneten Objekten dargestellt. In dem Bereich Unterobjekte ➋ sind die dem Objekt unterlagerten Objekte zu sehen und verlinkt. Neben der hierarchischen Verknüpfung der Objekte bietet xmera Omnia noch die logische Objektverknüpfung. Die Verknüpfung dient der Abbildung von Beziehungsstrukturen. Diese werden im Rahmen der Schutzbedarfsfeststellung für die automatische Vererbung benötigt. Daher bilden die Verknüpfungen eines Objekts die logischen Verbindungen zu Diensten anderer Objekte ab. Beispiele für solche Verknüpfungen sind Prozess nutzt Anwendung, Client nutzt Server oder Server steht im Serverraum. Die Festlegung der Objektverknüpfung erfolgt in der Objektkonfiguration. Die Verwaltung von Mitgliedern und deren Rollen ist nicht zentral für die Anwendung definiert, sondern erfolgt in jedem Objekt einzeln. Zentral verwaltet werden die Benutzer des Systems, also diejenigen, die Mitglieder von Objekten werden können, die Gruppen und die Zuordnung der Benutzer zu den Gruppen, als auch die Rollen und Rechte, die in der Anwendung genutzt werden können. Jedem Mitglied bzw. jeder Gruppe von Benutzern ist mindestens eine Rolle zugewiesen. Damit sind die Rechte jedes Mitglieds eindeutig definiert. Eine Sonderrolle spielen öffentliche Objekte. Wird ein Objekt als öffentlich parametriert, so können auch Nichtmitglieder und anonyme Benutzer (nicht angemeldet) Rechte im Objekt erhalten. Diese Rechte sind in den Rollen Nichtmitglied und Anonym definiert. Objekte können aus der Objektseite (siehe Bild) als auch, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, aus jeder Objektübersichtsseite als Unterobjekt angelegt werden. Wird die Auswahl Neues Objekt oder Neues Unterobjekt nicht angezeigt, so fehlt dem Anwender das entsprechende Recht. Es wird dann die Konfigurationsmaske des neuen Objekts geöffnet. Die wichtigsten Punkte werden in den folgenden Unterkapiteln beschrieben. Die mit * gekennzeichneten Felder sind Pflichtfelder und müssen ausgefüllt werden. Über eine CSV-Schnittstelle können Objekte in großer Zahl in xmera Omnia eingebracht werden. Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass entsprechend vorkonfigurierte Objektklassen bestehen. Der Objektimport erfolgt in 5 Schritten: Importdatei vorbereiten Eine für den Import von Objekten geeignete Importdatei muss folgende Daten beinhalten: Spaltenbezeichnung Datentyp Beschreibung Beispiel Name String Name des zu erzeugenden Objekts. (Pflichtfeld) Softwareentwicklung Beschreibung String Beschreibung des zu erzeugenden Objekts. (Optional) Entwicklung von Standardsoftware zur Produktionssteuerung Kennung String Kennung des zu erzeugenden Objekts: Länge zwischen 1 und 100 Zeichen. Kleinbuchstaben (a-z), Ziffern, Binde- und Unterstriche erlaubt. (Pflichtfeld) softwareentwicklung Öffentlich Boolean Soll das Objekt für alle Systembenutzer ohne Mitgliedschaft zugänglich sein? (Standard: false) false Unterobjekt von String Kennung des gewünschten Elternobjektes. (Pflichtfeld) prozess-informationen Benutzer erben Boolean Das zu erzeugende Objekt bekommt die selben Benutzer wie das Elternobjekt. (Optional) false Objektklasse String Kennung der Objektklasse, von der das zu erzeugende Objekt abgeleitet werden soll. (Pflichtfeld) okm-prozess [Objekt-Eigenes-Feld] [Feldtyp] [Objekt-Eigenes-Feld] = Name des eigenen Felds, das in der Objektlasse des erzeugenden Objekts definiert ist. [Feldtyp] hängt vom eigenen Feld ab und bestimmt den Wert. (Optional) Für ein Beispiel siehe Bild Feldzuordnung. Importdatei hochladen Der Einstiegspunkt für den Import von Objekten ist über das Topmenü durch Klick auf den Menüpunkt Objekte erreichbar. Wenn auf der Objektseite das 3-Punkte-Menü aufgeklappt wird, erscheint der Menüpunkt Importieren. Das Hochladen kann per Auswahl über den Dateimanager oder per Drag & Drop erfolgen. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um zu den CSV-Optionen zu kommen. CSV Optionen definieren Die konkrete Wahl der CSV Optionen hängt davon ab, wie die CSV-Datei erstellt wurde. Für die Kodierung ist im Normalfall UTF-8 die beste Wahl. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um die Datenfelder zuordnen zu können. Datenfelder zuordnen Wenn die Importdatei gut vorbereitet wurde, konnten alle Datenfelder automatisch zugeordnet werden. Andernfalls, muss eine manuelle Zuordnung durchgeführt werden. Dann auf Importieren klicken, um den Import zu starten Import durchführen Während des Imports kann anhand des Zählers der Importfortschritt beobachtet werden. Wenn der Import erfolgreich verlief, wird eine Liste der neuen Objekte angezeigt. Andernfalls erhält der Benutzer entsprechende Fehlermeldungen wie beispielhaft unten im Bild zu sehen ist. Der Importprozess wird nicht abgebrochen, wenn eine Zeile der CSV-Datei nicht fehlerfrei in ein Objekt überführt werden kann. Die nicht importierten Zeilen werden in Form ihrer Positionsnummer in der Fehlermeldung angezeigt und müssen separat in einem zweiten Versuch importiert werden. Objektklassen beschreiben einen typischen Aufbau eines Objekts. Dieser Aufbau wird im Objektklassen Master durch den Administrator gepflegt. Anpassbar sind beispielsweise Metadaten zu einem Objekt/Asset, Schutzbedarfsfeststellungen für Prozesse oder Informationsobjekte, Sicherheitsanforderungen, Gefährdungen, Standardaufgaben, Wiederkehrende Aufgaben, Wiki-Inhalte Tabellen wie bspw. Gerätelisten, Raumlisten, usw. diverse Aufgabenformulare, Kalender und Gantt-Diagramm, usw. Objektklassen werden zusätzlich als Parameter in einigen Objektmodulen und globalen Systemeinstellungen benötigt. Beispiele hierfür sind das Modul Aufgaben, Aufgaben-Synchronisation und das Modul Tabellen. Die Vorkonfiguration wird nach dem ersten Speichern beim Anlegen eines neuen Objekts an dieses übertragen. Die Vorkonfiguration von Objektklassen erfolgt aus der Administration der Anwendung. Wird ein Objekt von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet müssen lediglich die Pflichtfelder, Unterobjekt von und Benutzer erben ausgefüllt werden. Wird ein Objekt nicht von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet, erfolgt die Objektkonfiguration manuell. Objekte, die Asstes darstellen, müssen von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet werden, da die Schutzbedarfvererbung auf das Konzept der Objektklassen angewiesen ist! Der Objektname sollte ein Objekt möglichst gut beschreiben. Der Name kann nachträglich noch geändert werden. Beim Schreiben des Namens wird bei der ersten Einrichtung des Objekts automatisch die Kennung erstellt. Diese kann vor dem ersten Speichern geändert werden. Die Kennung muss eindeutig sein, darf keine Sonderzeichen und Umlaute enthalten und muss ausschließlich aus Kleinbuchstaben, optional mit Ganzzahlen kombiniert, bestehen. Wurde das Objekt gespeichert, kann die Kennung nicht mehr verändert werden! Die Objektbeschreibung ermöglicht es, einen längeren, das Objekt beschreibenden Text, Grafiken, Links u.ä. dem Objekt mitzugeben. Die Objektbeschreibung wird in der Objektübersicht unterhalb der Objektbezeichung dargestellt. Zur Erstellung der Beschreibung steht dem Anwender die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. Mögliche Textauszeichnungssprachen sind Markdown und Textile. Welcher Editor verwendet werden soll, muss im Administrationsbereich festgelegt werden. Dabei kann auch gänzlich auf eine Textauszeichnung verzichtet werden. Das Feld Objekt-Homepage bietet eine Möglichkeit einen externen Link auf einer Objektseite zu erfassen. Der Link wird oberhalb der Objektdaten auf der Übersichtsseite dargestellt. Mit setzen des Feldes wird das Objekt öffentlich. Alle Nutzer, die Zugang zu xmera Omnia haben, können Informationen des Objekts sehen. Ein nicht angemeldeter Nutzer ist automatisch mit den Rechten der Rolle Anonym ausgestattet. Jeder angemeldete Benutzer erhält automatisch die Rollenrechte der Rolle Nichtmitglied. Der Administrator kann in der Konfiguration vorgeben, dass eine Anmeldung zwingend notwendig ist. Damit wird verhindert, dass nicht autorisierte Nutzer mit dem System arbeiten können. Durch die Zuordnung des Objekts zu einem überlagerten Objekt wird der Hierarchiebaum erstellt. Wird ein Unterobjekt erstellt, ist dieses Feld bereits vorbelegt, kann aber geändert werden. Mit Setzen des Feldes werden die Mitglieder mit ihren Rollen aus dem übergeordneten Objekt übernommen. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit Objekten Eigene Felder zuzufügen. Die eigenen Felder werden durch den Administrator bereitgestellt und in der Konfigurationsmaske des Objekts gepflegt. Die Darstellung erfolgt in der Tabelle der spezifischen Objektdaten. Die Verknüpfungen basieren auf den Objektklassen. In der Konfiguration einer Objektklassen wird festgelegt, welche Objektklassen Dienste anbieten, die von anderen Objektklassen genutzt werden. In der Konfiguration des Objekts werden dann die konkreten Objektverknüpfungen festgelegt. Das Objekt mit seiner Objektklasse muss, damit die Objektverküpfungen aktiviert werden können, im xmera Omnia bekannt sein. Damit wird die Auswahl erst nach dem ersten Speichern des Objekts angezeigt. Das folgende Bild zeigt die Konfigurationsmaske eines Beispielobjekts. Zu sehen sind die bereitgestellten Dienste (Objekte einer Objektklasse), die mit dem Objekt in der Konfiguration verknüpft werden können. Objektmodule sind die Werkzeuge im xmera Omnia. Nicht in jedem Objekt werden alle Module benötigt. Damit die Anwendung nicht zu unübersichtlich wird, können die Module zu jedem Objekt ein und ausgeschaltet werden. Ein Beispiel ist im folgenden Bild zu sehen: Die aktivierten Module werden als Reiter in den Objektmasken angezeigt. Für die oben dargestellte Auswahl ergibt sich dann folgende Menüleiste: Wird ein Modul deaktiviert, in dem bereits Daten erfasst wurden, so werden die bereits erfassten Daten nicht gelöscht. Wird das Modul wieder aktiviert, so werden diese Daten wieder angezeigt. Über den Reiter Mitglieder der Konfigurationsseite eines Objekts lassen sich Mitgliederrollen verwalten. In der Liste sind, siehe Punkt ➊, alle Mitglieder und Gruppen mit ihren Rollen gelistet. Über den Button ➋ können neue Mitglieder mit aufgenommen werden und mit der Bearbeitung bzw. dem Löschen ➌ lassen sich die Einträge verändern oder entfernen. Nutzern mit Administrationsrechten wird der Button Administration ➍ angeboten. Über diesen Button kommt der Administrator direkt in die Benutzerverwaltung. Aus einem überlagerten Objekt geerbte Mitglieder und deren Rollen können nicht gelöscht werden. Es können nur weitere Mitglieder oder Rollen hinzugefügt werden und nur diese Einträge lassen sich auch wieder löschen. Sollen neue Mitglieder hinzugefügt werden, wird ein weiteres Fenster mit den möglichen Mitgliedern und Gruppen sowie die Liste der möglichen Rollen angezeigt. Für die Aufnahme von Mitgliedern sind die Benutzer bzw. die Gruppen auszuwählen, die aufgenommen werden sollen. Weiter ist die Rolle bzw. sind die Rollen auszuwählen, die Mitglieder in diesem Objekt haben sollen. Nur in der Kombination aus Benutzer/Gruppe mit der/den Rolle(n) können neue Mitglieder durch Klicken des Buttons Hinzufügen aufgenommen werden. Sollen Rollen eines Mitglieds oder einer Gruppe verändert werden, so erfogt das über den Button Bearbeiten. Es wird der Listeintrag des ausgewählten Mitarbeiters aufgeklappt und durch An- oder Abwahl können die Rollen verändert werden. Rollen, die ein Mitglied von einer Gruppe oder dem vorgelagerten Objekt geerbt hat, können nicht verädert werden. Dieses ist in der Maske gekennzeichnet. Werden alle Rollen eines Mitglieds gelöscht, wird dieses Mitglied gelöscht. Das Journal eines Objekts zeigt die Aktivitäten von ausgewählten Modulen chronologisch an. Beim Standardaufruf werden die letzten 10 Tage bis zum aktuellen Datum angezeigt. Das Datum kann durch den Nutzer geändert werden. Die Anzahl der Tage, im Standard 10, die chronologisch dargestellt werden, kann in der Systemkonfiguration angepasst werden. In der Sidebar besteht die Möglichkeit die Aktivitäten zu filtern. So können die Aktivitäten durch Auswahl der Module, die betrachtet werden sollen, eingeschränkt werden. Weiter können die angezeigten Aktivitäten auf eine Person eingegrenzt werden. Änderungen werden mit dem Button Anwenden übernommen. Die Liste der Aktivitäten wird danach neu aufgebaut. Die Aktivitäten sind als Links dargestellt, so dass direkt zu den Änderungen gesprungen werden kann.","title":"Objekte","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"objekte","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/anwenderhandbuch/objekte.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktion der Objekte","hash":"_funktion_der_objekte","id":1},{"text":"Objektübersicht","hash":"_objektübersicht","id":2},{"text":"Objekthierarchie","hash":"_objekthierarchie","id":3},{"text":"Objektverknüpfungen","hash":"_objektverknüpfungen","id":4},{"text":"Objektmitglieder","hash":"_objektmitglieder","id":5},{"text":"Objekte erstellen","hash":"_objekte_erstellen","id":6},{"text":"Objekte manuell erstellen","hash":"_objekte_manuell_erstellen","id":7},{"text":"Objekte importieren","hash":"_objekte_importieren","id":8},{"text":"Objekte konfigurieren","hash":"_objekte_konfigurieren","id":9},{"text":"Objektklassen","hash":"_objektklassen","id":10},{"text":"Objektname","hash":"_objektname","id":11},{"text":"Objektkennung","hash":"_objektkennung","id":12},{"text":"Objektbeschreibung","hash":"_objektbeschreibung","id":13},{"text":"Objekt-Homepage","hash":"_objekt_homepage","id":14},{"text":"Öffentlich","hash":"_öffentlich","id":15},{"text":"Unterobjekt von","hash":"_unterobjekt_von","id":16},{"text":"Benutzer erben","hash":"_benutzer_erben","id":17},{"text":"Objektdaten","hash":"_objektdaten","id":18},{"text":"Objektverknüpfungen","hash":"_objektverknüpfungen_2","id":19},{"text":"Objektmodule","hash":"_objektmodule","id":20},{"text":"Mitglieder verwalten","hash":"_mitglieder_verwalten","id":21},{"text":"Objektjournal","hash":"_objektjournal","id":22}]},"37":{"id":37,"text":"Einführung","title":"Einführung","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"3.7","name":"index","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/3.7/index.html","titles":[]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"Einführung","title":"Einführung","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/index.html","titles":[]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"Der Aufgabenstatus beschreibt den aktuellen Prozessschritt im Aufgabenablauf (Workflow).

Das Hochladen kann per Auswahl über den Dateimanager oder per Drag & Drop erfolgen. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um zu den CSV-Optionen zu kommen. CSV Optionen definieren Die konkrete Wahl der CSV-Optionen hängt davon ab, wie die CSV-Datei erstellt wurde. Für die Kodierung ist im Normalfall UTF-8 die beste Wahl. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um die Datenfelder zuordnen zu können. Datenfelder zuordnen Wenn die Importdatei gut vorbereitet wurde, können alle Datenfelder automatisch zugeordnet werden. Andernfalls, muss eine manuelle Zuordnung durchgeführt werden. Dann auf Importieren klicken, um den Import zu starten Import durchführen Während des Imports kann anhand des Zählers der Importfortschritt beobachtet werden. Wenn der Import erfolgreich verlief, wird eine Liste der neuen Objekte angezeigt. Andernfalls erhält der Benutzer entsprechende Fehlermeldungen wie beispielhaft unten im Bild zu sehen ist. Der Importprozess wird nicht abgebrochen, wenn eine oder mehrere Zeilen nicht verarbeitet werden können. Die nicht importierten Zeilen werden in Form ihrer Positionsnummer in der Fehlermeldung angezeigt und müssen separat in einem zweiten Versuch importiert werden. Über die Konfiguration kann bei der Authentifizierung die Selbstregistrierung gewählt werden. Bei dieser Art, kann sich ein neuer Benutzer mit seinen Daten (Mitgliedsnamen, Vor- und Nachnamen, E-Mailadresse und Passwort) registrieren. Je nach Anmeldeoption kann der registrierte Benutzer automatisch, nach einer E-Mailbestätigung oder durch einen Administrator aktiviert werden. Benutzer können über eine LDAP-Kopplung mit einem LDAP-Server verwaltet werden. Die Anbindung und die Funktionen werden im Kapitel LDAP-Authentifizierung beschrieben. Durch Klick auf den Mitgliedsnamen in der Benutzerliste gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsmaske des Benutzers. Im oberen Bereich finden sich mehrere Taps und Funktionsbutton. Benutzerprofil Ein Klick auf den Button führt auf das Profil des Benutzers, in dem die zugewiesenen Aufgaben und sonstige Aktivitäten aufgezeigt werden. E-Mails Durch Klick auf den Button können dem Anwender weitere E-Mailadressen zugewiesen werden. Die Bedienung ist im Anwenderhandbuch im Kapitel Mein Konto beschrieben. Sperren / Entsperren Weiter kann das Konto durch Klick auf den Button gesperrt bzw. entsperrt werden. Löschen Durch Klick auf den Button kann das Benutzerkonto gelöscht werden. Es muss dann nochmals bestätigt werden, dass der Benutzer gelöscht werden soll. Das Löschen kann nicht rückgängig gemacht werden. Mit dem Löschen gehen alle Referenzen zu dem Benutzer verloren. Häufig ist es sinnvoller den Benutzer nur zu sperren. Bearbeitungsmasken Über die drei Taps werden die Bearbeitungsmasken für die allgemeinen Daten, die Gruppenzuordnung und die Objektrollen dargestellt. Diese werden im Folgenden beschrieben. Im Tap Allgemein können die Kontodaten des Benutzers angepasst werden. Das Formular entspricht dem beim manuellen Anlegen eines Benutzers. Die Beschreibungen zu den einzelen Feldern / Attributen finden sich im Adminhandbuch im Kapitel manuell Anlegen und im Anwenderhandbuch im Kapitel Mein Konto. Im Tap Gruppen sind die Gruppen aktiviert, denen der Benutzer zugeordnet ist. In dem Beispiel oben sind es das DSMS-Team und das ISMS-Team. Durch Setzen oder Entfernen der Haken vor den Gruppen und dem anschließenden Speichern kann die Gruppenzuordnung geändert werden. Der Tap Objekte zeigt die Objekte an, in denen der Benutzer Rechte mittels einer oder mehrerer Rollen besitzt. Im Beispiel unten hat der Benutzer in einem der gelisteten Objekte gleich zwei Rollen. In diesem Fall kummulieren sich die Rechte. Objektzuordnung ändern Die Rollenzuordnung zu jedem einzelnen Objekt kann in der Objektkonfiguration im Tab Mitglieder festgelegt werden. Der Administrator hat aber auch hier die Möglichkeit die Zuordnung zu bearbeiten. Die Rollen, die ein Benutzer in einem der aufgeführten Objekte hat, kann über den Button erfolgen. Es werden verfügbare Rollen gelistet und durch Setzen oder Entfernen der Häkchen werden die Rollen aktiviert oder deaktiviert. Durch Speichern werden die Änderungen übernommen. Rechte, die der Benutzer durch die Gruppenzugehörigkeit erhalten hat, können an dieser Stelle nicht verändert werden. Ebenso lassen sich diese Objektzuordnungen nicht löschen. Objektzuordnung löschen Durch den Button kann die Rolle in einem Objekt komplett gelöscht werden. Objektzuordnung hinzufügen Soll ein Benutzer Rollen in Objekten erhalten, die noch nicht in der Liste enthalten sind, so erfolgt dieses über den Button . Es wird eine Maske mit der Objektstruktur und den Rollen angezeigt. In dieser Maske ist die Kombination aus Objekt(en) und Rolle(n) auszuwählen, die dem Benutzer zugeordnet werden sollen. Mit Klick auf den Button werden die Anpassungen übernommen.","title":"Benutzer","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"benutzer","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/adminhandbuch/benutzer.html","titles":[{"text":"Benutzer anlegen","hash":"_benutzer_anlegen","id":1},{"text":"Manuell","hash":"_manuell","id":2},{"text":"Importieren","hash":"_importieren","id":3},{"text":"Selbstregistrierung","hash":"_selbstregistrierung","id":4},{"text":"LDAP-Benutzer","hash":"_ldap_benutzer","id":5},{"text":"Benutzer bearbeiten","hash":"_benutzer_bearbeiten","id":6},{"text":"Allgemein","hash":"_allgemein","id":7},{"text":"Gruppen","hash":"_gruppen","id":8},{"text":"Objekte","hash":"_objekte","id":9}]},"43":{"id":43,"text":"In xmera Omnia können systemseitige Bezeichnungen in verschiedenen Sprachen angezeigt werden.

Detailierte Aufgabenrechte Im Bereich der Aufgaben können die für die Rolle zur Verfügung stehenden Aufgabentypen eingeschränkt werden. Dabei werden folgende Rechte unterschieden: Aufgabe anzeigen: Aufgaben von dem Typ werden der Rolle angezeigt. Aufgaben hinzufügen: Aufgaben von dem Typ können von der Rolle angelegt werden. Aufgaben bearbeiten: Aufgaben von dem Typ können von der Rolle bearbeitet und gelöscht werden. Kommentare hinzufügen: Aufgaben können von der Rolle kommentiert werden. Im Standard sind alle Rechte für alle Aufgabentypen aktiv. Soll der Standard geändert werden, muss zunächst die Auswahl Alle Aufgabentypen bei dem zu ändernden Recht abgewählt werden.

Dabei kann es von Bedeutung sein, welcher Mitarbeiter oder welche Rolle eine Statusänderung vornehmen darf. Die Abfolge der Status und die Berechtigungen zur Statusänderung können mit Hilfe der Workflows gesteuert werden. So kann z.B. nur Mitgliedern, die die Rolle Aufgabenverantwortlich haben, das Recht gegeben werden, eine Aufgabe auf den Status storniert zu setzen. Weiter bieten Workflows die Möglichkeit, die Sichtbarkeit und Bearbeitbarkeit jedes einzelnen Aufgabendatenfeldes für jede Rolle festzulegen. Somit kann auch hier eine rollenbasierte Bearbeitung der Aufgaben abgebildet werden. Ein Workflow beschreibt damit die Rechte einer Rolle für einem Aufgabentyp in Bezug auf erlaubte Statusänderungen und die Bearbeitung von Aufgabendatenfeldern. Ist für einen Aufgabentyp kein Workflow definiert, so kann der Aufgabentyp zwar einer Aufgabe zugeordnet werden. Jedoch kann der Status dann von keiner Rolle (einschließlich Administrator) mehr verändert werden. Bearbeitet werden die Workflows im Administrationsbereich über den Menüpunkt Workflow. Es erscheint folgende Ansicht: In der Erstansicht werden zwei Tabs, Statusänderungen und Feldberechtigungen, angeboten. In beiden Tabs ist für die Bearbeitung die Kombination aus Rolle und Aufgabentyp festzulegen. Mit dem Button wird für die gewählte Kombination der Bearbeitungsbereich eingeblendet. Workflows müssen nicht vom Administrator angelegt werden, da mit dem Anlegen einer Rolle oder eines Aufgabentyps automatisch ein Workflow ohne Rechte zur Statusänderung und den vollen Rechten zur Feldberechtigung angelegt wird. Die Darstellung und Bearbeitung der Berechtigungen einer Rolle in einem Aufgabentyp erfolgt, in dem auf der Workflowseite die Rolle und der Aufgabentyp gewählt werden und diese Auswahl mit dem Button aufgerufen wird. Es wird, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, eine Statusmatrix angezeigt. Die Zeilen beschreiben den Ausgangsstatus, aus dem eine Änderung erfolgen soll. Die Spalten beschreiben die Zielstatus, in die der Ausgangsstatus verändert werden kann. Die Statusmatrix im Bild oben zeigt eine Rolle, die keine Rechte hat, einen Status zu verändern. So kann in dem Beispiel die Rolle Meldungsberechtigter eine Aufgabe von dem Typ Meldung anlegen, aber dabei keinen Status wählen, da in der Zeile Neue Aufgabe kein Zielstatus angekreuzt ist. Bei den anderen Zeilen ist (automatisch) jeweils nur der Haken beim Zielstatus gleich Ausgangsstatus gesetzt, womit keine Statusänderung für diese Rolle möglich ist. Um Statusänderungen durchführen zu können, muss für den entsprechenden Ausgangsstatus der Zielstatus definiert werden, damit die gewählte Rolle einen Bearbeitungsschritt einleiten oder abschließen kann. In dem Beispiel oben darf die Rolle aus dem Status In Bearbeitung in den Status Umgesetzt oder Feedback gesetzt werden. Aus dem Status Feedback kann die Aufgabe wiederum in den Status In Bearbeitung zurück versetzt werden. In der Standardeinstellung ist die Einstellung Zeige nur die Status an, die von diesem Aufgabentyp verwendet werden aktiviert. Wird die Einstellung zurückgenommen (siehe roter Kringel im folgenden Bild), werden alle im System vorhandenen Status angezeigt. Somit lassen sich für den Aufgabentyp weitere Status in den Workflow einbinden. Übernommen werden die Änderungen mit dem Klick auf den Button . Unterhalb der Statusmatrix können erweiterte Statusberechtigungen für den Autor oder das zugewiesenen Mitglied vorgenommen werden. Die Statusmatrix für diese besonderen Rollen kann durch Klick auf den Pfeil (rote Kreise in den Bildern unten) neben der Überschrift ein- und ausgeblendet werden. Werden in diesen Matrizen weitere Berechtigungen festgelegt, kann ein Autor oder das zugewiesene Mitglied mit der Rolle des Workflows diese erweiterten Rechte nutzen. Im Tab Feldberechtigung besteht die Möglichkeit jedes Aufgabendatenfeld für die gewählte Rolle in Abhängigkeit vom Status der Aufgabe für die Bearbeitung zu sperren (Nur-Lese-Zugriff) oder zum Pflichtfeld zu machen (Erforderlich). Dieses wird, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, in einer Feld/Status-Matrix umgesetzt. Für jede Feld-Status-Kombination kann die Berechtigung verändert werden. Dafür können über das Dropdown-Menü die Einträge verändert werden. Bei Pflichtfeldern steht die Auswahl Erforderlich nicht zur Verfügung, da dieses Feld bereits diesen Status besitzt. Mit dem Klick auf den Button , der unterhalb oder rechts vom Auswahlfeld ist, kann die Feldberechtigung in die folgenden Felder kopiert werden. Ein Beispiel ist im folgenden Bild zu sehen. Das Feld Zugewiesen an ist im Status Neu optional. Wird der Status in Bearbeitung gesetzt, ist es ein Pflichtfeld. In den weiteren Status kann es nicht verändert werden. Da der Aufwand, einen Aufgabentyp per Workflows zu definieren, recht hoch ist, ist das Kopieren und anschließende Anpassen der kopierten Workflows häufig der sinnvollere Weg. Aus diesem Grund wird bei der Erstellung einer Rolle oder Erstellung eines Aufgabentyps direkt das Kopieren der Workflows von einer bestehenden Rolle oder eines bestehenden Aufgabentyps angeboten. Dieses kann aber auch im Nachgang über die Kopierfunktion im Workflowbereich umgesetzt werden. Im oberen rechten Bereich kann die Kopierfunktion über den Button aufgerufen werden. Er erscheint folgende Eingabemöglichkeit: In dieser Maske kann im Bereich Quelle eine Kombination aus Aufgabentyp und Rolle gewählt werden. Dieser Workflow wird dann in eine oder mehrere Workflows (im Bereich Ziel ist eine Mehrfachauswahl möglich) kopiert. Um nicht jeden Workflow einzeln kopieren zu müssen, kann als Quelle So wie das Ziel definiert werden. Somit ist es auf diese Weise zum Beispiel möglich, einer Zielrolle alle Rechte einer Quellrolle zuzuordnen, in dem als Quellaufgabentyp die Auswahl So wie das Ziel gewählt wird und über die Mehrfachauswahl im Zielaufgabentyp alle Aufgabentypen ausgewählt werden. Im oberen rechten Bereich der Workflowseite kann durch Klick auf den Button die Zusammenfassung der Workflows aufgerufen werden. Die Zusammenfassung ist eine Kreuztabelle. In den Zeilen werden die Aufgabentypen und in den Spalten die Rollen dargestellt. Jede Kombination aus Aufgabentyp und Rolle bildet einen Workflow ab.

Die Synchronisation dient der automatisierten Zuordnung von Aufgaben zu Objekten. Zur Durchführung einer Synchronisation müssen einige Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: Es existiert ein Katalog-Objekt, das die zu synchronisierenden Elemente enthält. Das Katalog-Objekt wurde innerhalb der globalen Konfiguration angegeben. Ein Eigenes Feld wurde innerhalb der globalen Konfiguration als Zuordnungselement gewählt. Das Modul Aufgaben-Synchronisation ist in dem zu synchronisierenden Objekt aktiviert und konfiguriert. In der Administration wird festgelegt, in welchem Objekt die Aufgaben liegen, die synchronisiert werden sollen (Katalog-Objekt). Weiter wird festgelegt, welche Aufgabentypen zur Synchronisation genutzt werden können und in welchem eigenen Feld die Zuordnungselemente abgebildet werden. Die zu synchronisierenden Aufgaben müssen dieses Eigenes Feld besitzen und dem gewählten Aufgabentyp entsprechen. In dem zu synchronisierenden Objekt muss das Modul Aufgaben-Synchronisation aktiviert sein und es muss in der Modulkonfiguration mindestens ein möglicher Wert als Zuordnungselement ausgewählt sein. Bei der Synchronisation werden die Standard-Kopiermechanismen des Systems genutzt, so dass hier die in der Administration gewählte Option, wie mit der Verlinkung beim Kopieren umgegangen wird, auch für den Synchronisationsprozess gilt. Gestartet wird die Aufgaben-Synchronisation aus dem Reiter Aufgaben. Hier wird bei Aktivierung des Moduls Aufgaben-Synchronisation im 3-Punkte-Menü die Auswahl Synchronisieren angeboten. Mit dem Klick auf Synchronisieren wird der Synchoronisationsdialog geöffnet. In dieser Maske werden zunächst Quell- und Zielobjekt dargestellt. Wenn bei der Aufgabensynchronisation mehrere Aufgabentypen für die Synchronisation konfiguriert wurden, besteht die Möglichkeit, die Synchronisation auf einen (Dropdown) oder mehrere ( + ) Aufgabentypen einzugrenzen. Nach einer Änderung in der Auswahl eines Aufgabentyps muss durch einen Klick auf Aktualisieren die Neuberechnung der zu synchronisierenden Aufgaben angestoßen werden. Unterhalb der Auswahl der Aufgabentypen werden die Zielobjektklassen aufgelistet. Im Beispiel sind es die Klassen: Büroraum, Home-Office/Mobiler Arbeitsplatz, Serverraum, Technikraum. Es wird die Anzahl an Aufgaben dargestellt (im Beispiel 4 Aufgaben), die synchronisiert werden können. Klappt man den Bereich auf, werden die Aufgaben konkret aufgelistet. Mit dem Klick auf den Button wird der Synchronisationsprozess gestartet. Um das Bündeln von Aufgaben an einem überlagerten Objekt zu ermöglichen, steht die Funktionalität des Systemobjekts zur Verfügung. Ist ein Objekt ein Systemobjekt, so werden beim Synchronisieren nicht nur die Kriterien des Systemobjekts, sondern auch die aus den hierarchisch unterlagerten Objekten berücksichtigt. Wird die Synchronisation an einem Objekt durchgeführt, das ein überlagertes Systemobjekt besitzt, wird die Synchronisation mit der Fehlermeldung (Objektname) wird über sein übergeordnetes Objekt synchronisiert. abgebrochen. Beispiel: Das Systemobjekt wird in der Modulkonfiguration des Objektes festgelegt. Werden in einem Hierarchiebaum mehrere Systemobjekte gesetzt, so kann die Synchronisation nur am obersten Objekt ausgeführt werden, da alle unterlagerten Objekte ein überlagertes Systemobjekt besitzen und damit (siehe Notiz oben) der Synchronisationsprozess abgebrochen wird.","title":"Aufgaben-Synchronisation","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"aufgaben-synchronisation","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/aufgaben-synchronisation.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktionen Aufgaben-Synchronisation","hash":"_funktionen_aufgaben_synchronisation","id":1},{"text":"Voraussetungen zur Synchronisation","hash":"_voraussetungen_zur_synchronisation","id":2},{"text":"Starten und Durchführen der Synchronisation","hash":"_starten_und_durchführen_der_synchronisation","id":3},{"text":"Funktionsweise Systemobjekt","hash":"_funktionsweise_systemobjekt","id":4}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"Aufgaben sind das wichtigste Modul in der Anwendung.

Hier besteht die Möglichkeit durch Deaktivieren von Standardfeldern (bis auf die Pflichtfelder) oder das Hinzufügen von eigenen Feldern das Aufgabenformular individuell zu gestalten. Das Modul Aufgaben muss im Objekt aktiviert werden. Ist das Modul aktiviert, wird im Objektmenü Aufgaben angezeigt. Wird das Menüelement Aufgaben angeklickt, wird die Aufgabenübersicht angezeigt. Die Aufgabenübersicht zeigt alle nicht abgeschlossenen Aufgaben des Objekts inklusive den Aufgaben der Unterobjekte an. Die Objektübersicht baut sich wie folgt auf: ➊ Aufgabenliste ➋ Seitennavigation ➌ Filter und Darstellungsoptionen ➍ Abfragen ➎ Neue Aufgabe & 3-Punkte-Menü ➏ Aufgabenexport Die Aufgabenliste zeigt die Aufgaben nach ihrer ID sortiert an. Die Sortierung kann durch Klicken auf die Spalte, nach der sortiert werden soll, geändert werden. Die Reihenfolge der Sortierung wird durch nochmaliges Klicken auf die Spaltenüberschrift geändert werden. Die Suchreihenfolge wird durch die Symbole und in der Spaltenüberschrift dargestellt. Die Attribute ID und Thema sind mit der Aufgabe verlinkt. Andere Links, wie z.B. der Benutzer, an den die Aufgabe zugewiesen wurde, zeigt auf sein Benutzerprofil. Die Anzahl der Aufgaben auf einer Übersichtsseite ist begrenzt. Zum Blättern in einer mehrseitigen Aufgabenliste sind am Ende der Liste Navigationsbutton. Die Anzahl der Aufgaben auf einer Seite ist durch den Administrator konfigurierbar. In der Standardeinstellung sind es 25, 50 oder 100 Elemente pro Seite. Der Filter funktioniert analog zum Objektfilter. Siehe hierzu Kapitel Bediengrundlagen » Abschnitt Objekt- und Aufgabenlisten. Die Abfrage funktioniert analog zur Objektabfrage. Siehe hierzu Kapitel Bediengrundlagen » Abschnitt Objekt- und Aufgabenlisten. Über den Button Neue Aufgabe kann, wie weiter unten beschrieben, eine neue Aufgabe angelegt werden. Das 3-Punkte-Menü beinhaltet die Möglichkeiten: eine Zusammenfassung (Statistik und graphische Auswertungen) aufzurufen, Aufgaben zu importieren, in die Aufgabenkonfiguration zu springen und eine Synchronisation anzustoßen. Das vollständige Menü wird nur bei den entsprechenden Berechtigungen angezeigt. Zusammenfassung Die Zusammenfassung zeigt in einem Bericht die Anzahl der Aufgaben nach dem Umsetzungsgrad in Bezug auf verschiedene fest vorgegebene Kriterien an. Zu jeder Auswertung gibt es eine graphische Darstellung. Importieren Mit der Importfunktion besteht die Möglichkeit über eine CSV-Datei Aufgaben zu importieren. Konfiguration Mit dem Menüpunkt Konfiguration springt der Anwender direkt in die Aufgabenkonfiguration des Objekts. Synchronisation Mit dem Menüpunkt Synchronisation wird der Synchronisationsdialog für das Synchronisieren von Aufgabenlisten geöffnet. Die Aufgabenliste kann in verschiedenen Formaten exportiert werden ➏. Die Auswahl ist unterhalb der Aufgabenliste auf der rechten Seite zu finden. Es stehen drei Formate zu Verfügung: Atom (xml nach Atom-Standard) CSV-Datei PDF-Datei Im Atom- und PDF-Format wird die gesamte im Filter ➌ definierte Aufgabenliste exportiert. Beim Starten des CSV-Exports öffnet sich folgendes Fenster: Durch die Auswahl der Optionen und Attribute lässt sich die Ausgabe näher bestimmen. Für die Nutzung von Umlauten ist die Kodierung UTF-8 zu wählen. über den Button Aufgabe anlegen wird das Formular zum Anlegen einer Aufgabe geöffnet. In diesem Formular werden alle Basisdaten für eine Aufgabe erfasst. Die Pflichtfelder sind mit einem roten * gekennzeichnet. ➊ Das Attribut Objekt gibt an, welchem Objekt die Aufgabe zugeordnet ist. Dieses Attribut wird mit dem Objekt vorbelegt, aus dem die Erstellungsmaske aufgerufen wurde. ➋ Der Formularaufbau mit den zu erfassenden Daten und der Statusführung (Workflow) hängt vom Aufgabentyp ab. Mit der Auswahl eines Aufgabentyps wird das zugehörige Formular neu geladen, um alle aufgabenspezifischen Felder anzeigen zu können. Das Bild oben zeigt den Aufgabentyp Maßnahme, der Eingabefelder zur Wirksamkeitsprüfung enthält. ➌ Das Thema ist die Kurzbeschreibung der Aufgabe. Es wird in der Aufgabenübersicht dargestellt und sollte daher die Aufgabe so beschreiben, dass diese sich von den anderen Aufgaben im Objekt unterscheidet. ➍ Im Beschreibungsfeld kann die Aufgabe ausführlich erklärt werden. Zur Formatierung des Textes steht die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. ➎ Der Status gibt den Bearbeitungsstand der Aufgabe wieder. Zu jedem Aufgabetyp gibt es einen Startwert. Die Statusführung wird durch die Administration für jeden Aufgabentyp einzeln festgelegt. ➏ Hier wird die Priorität festgelegt. Es werden im Standard - Niedrig - Normal - Hoch - Dringend - Sofort unterschieden. Die Prioritäten lassen sich durch den Administrator anpassen. ➐ Mit diesem Feld wird festgelegt, wer für die Durchführung der Aufgabe verantwortlich ist. Zur Auswahl stehen alle Benutzer, die in dem der Aufgabe zugewiesenen Objekt das Recht besitzen, Aufgaben auszuführen. ➑ Aufgaben können hierarchisch organisiert werden. In der Unteraufgabe wird dazu die übergeordnete Aufgabe angegeben. Weitere Erläuterungen sind im Abschnitt Unteraufgabe. ➒ Mit dem Datum für den Beginn und dem Abgabedatum der Aufgabe kann der Zeitrahmen aufgespannt werden, in dem die Aufgabe durchgeführt werden soll. Für die Module Kalender und Verlauf werden diese Informationen benötigt, um die Aufgabe zeitlich einzuordnen. ➓ Im Feld geschätzter Aufwand kann der zu erwartende Aufwand in Stunden zur Durchführung der Aufgabe dokumentiert werden. ⓫ Im Feld % erledigt kann der Umsetzungsgrad der Maßnahme mitgeführt werden. Hierfür steht eine zehn-stufige Skala zur Verfügung. ⓬ Jedem Aufgabentyp können eigene Felder zugeordnet werden. Diese dienen der Dokumentation von aufgabenspezifischen Informationen. So wird in dem oben dargestellten Screenshot das Ergebnis der Wirksamkeitsprüfung dokumentiert. Die Felder lassen sich im Rahmen der Administration an die Organisation anpassen. ⓭ Es können Dateien an eine Aufgabe angehängt werden. Mit dem Button Durchsuchen wird der Dateimanager des Anwenderrechners geöffnet, in dem eine oder mehrere Dateien ausgewählt werden können. Jeder Datei kann eine Beschreibung zugeordnet werden. Die maximale Größe einer Datei ist dabei im Standard auf 5 MB begrenzt. Die Dateigröße ist durch den Administrator anpassbar. ⓮ Der Bereich Dokumente ist nur verfügbar, wenn das Modul DMS (Dokumentenmanagement) aktiviert wurde. An dieser Stelle des Formulars können Dokumente eingebunden werden. Diese werden entweder hochgeladen und im DMS gespeichert oder sie werden, wenn schon im DMS abgelegt, mit der Aufgabe verknüpft. Somit besteht die Möglichkeit Dokumente, die aufgabenübergreifend benötigt werden und daher zentral zu dokumentieren sind, direkt über eine Aufgabe zu erfassen. ⓯ Beobachter sind Mitglieder des Objekts, die über Änderungen in der Aufgabe per E-Mail informiert werden. Über die Kontrollkästchen werden die Personen festgelegt, die diese Aufgabe beobachten sollen. ⓰ Mit dem Attribut Privat kann der Anwender eine Aufgabe erstellen, die nur von ihm selbst und berechtigten Anwendern (z.B. Administratoren) gelesen werden kann. ⓱ Mit dem Button Anlegen oder Anlegen und weiter wird die Erfassung der neuen Aufgabe abgeschlossen. Dafür müssen mindestens die Pflichtfelder gefüllt sein. Wird der Prozess über Anlegen abgeschlossen, so wird die Erfassung beendet und die Ansicht wechselt auf die Aufgabenübersichtsseite. Wird der Prozess mit dem Button Anlegen und weiter abgeschlossen, so wird eine neues Aufgabenformular geöffnet und ein weitere Aufgabe kann erfasst werden. Ruft man eine Aufgabe auf, so öffnet sich folgendes Formular: Im Formular werden alle Informationen zur Aufgabe dargestellt. Es handelt sich konkret um folgende Informationen: ➊ Jede Aufgabe erhält automatisch eine eindeutige Aufgaben ID. Diese wird für die eindeutige Identifizierung der Aufgabe verwendet. Die ID kommt insbesondere bei der Verknüpfung von Aufgaben zum Einsatz. ➋ Zum Aufgabenname werden zusätzlich der Autor, die Zeiten der Erfassung und der letzten Aktualisierung dargestellt. ➌ Unterhalb des Aufgabennamens wird der aktuelle Status der Aufgabe angezeigt. Neben dem Aufgabenstatus sind die Priorität, die zugewiesene Person/Gruppe, die zeitlichen Vorgaben sowie der Erledigungsgrad typische Felder, die zur Standardkonfiguration eines Aufgabentyps gehören. ➍ Die Beschreibung der Aufgabe kann mit Hilfe des integrierten Editors formatiert werden. Mit dem Element Zitieren , oben rechts vom Beschreibungsfeld, wird die Kommentarfunktion der Aufgabe aufgerufen, mit der Beschreibung als Zitat vorangestellt. ➎ In dem Bereich Dateien werden die der Aufgabe angehängten Dateien gelistet. Die Dateien können heruntergeladen , gelöscht oder die Dateibeschreibung geändert werden. ➏ Im Bereich Unteraufgaben werden, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die der Aufgabe unterlagerten Aufgaben mit ihrem Status angezeigt. Durch den Link Hinzufügen kann eine neue Unteraufgabe hinzugefügt werden. Es erscheint die Maske für eine neue Aufgabe, in der das Attribut Übergeordnete Aufgabe bereits vorbelegt ist. Eine neue oder bestehende Aufgabe kann auch durch Zuordnung der übergeordneten Aufgabe im Feld Übergeordnete Aufgabe dieser Aufgabe als Unteraufgabe zugeordnet werden. Ist eine Aufgabe eine Unteraufgabe, so wird die übergeordnete Aufgabe, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, oberhalb des Aufgabennamens dargestellt und verlinkt. In dem Bereich Unteraufgaben kann man durch Anklicken der Aufgaben ID der Unteraufgabe in ihre Einzelansicht springen. Man kann aber auch die Unteraufgabe direkt bearbeiten. Durch Klicken auf das Symbol kann die Verbindung zur Unteraufgabe gelöst werden. Durch das 3-Punkte-Menü kann der Status der Unteraufgabe direkt verändert werden. Das Menü hat folgendes Aussehen: Wie zu erkennen, kann man einerseits in die Bearbeitungsmaske der Unteraufgabe springen, aber auch die wichtigsten Felder direkt verändern. Selbst das Erstellen einer Unteraufgabe zur Unteraufgabe ist möglich, wie das Kopieren als auch das Löschen. In der Systemadministration kann festgelegt werden, dass der Status der Unteraufgaben den Status der übergeordneten Aufgabe bestimmt. Somit werden die Status als auch der % erledigt auf den Status der übergeordneten Aufgabe übertragen. ➐ Zugehörige Aufgaben ermöglichen es dem Anwender, eine Aufgabe mit anderen Aufgaben zu verknüpfen, um Duplikate zu vermeiden oder die Arbeitsabläufe zu vereinfachen. Die zugeordneten Aufgaben werden, wie im Bild zu sehen, mit ihrer Art der Beziehung und dem Status aufgelistet. Entsprechend den Bedienmöglichkeiten der Unteraufgaben läßt sich durch Klicken auf das Symbol die Verbindung aufheben und durch die Auswahl im 3-Punkte-Menü die zugehörige Aufgabe bearbeiten. Durch Klicken auf hinzufügen lassen sich Aufgaben hinzufügen. Es erscheint folgende Auswahl: Es lassen sich verschieden Arten der Beziehungen darstellen. Beziehung mit Es wird nur ein Link zu einer anderen Aufgabe hergestellt Duplikat von / Dupliziert durch Ein Duplikat verbindet die Aufgaben in der Weise, dass beim Schließen der Aufgabe ein Duplikat von mit gelöscht wurde. Ist die Aufgabe dagegen Dupliziert durch eine zugeordneten Aufgabe so wird die Aufgabe gelöscht, sobald die zugeordnete Aufgabe geschlossen wird, aber nicht umgekehrt. Blockiert / Blockiert durch Blockiert eine zugeordnete Aufgabe so lange davor geschlossen zu werden, bis die aktuelle Aufgabe geschlossen ist bzw. das Schließen der Aufgabe wird Blockiert durch die zugehörige Aufgabe. Vorgänger von / Nachfolger von Die zugeordnete Aufgabe ist Vorgänger von oder Nachfolger von. Durch diese Verknüpfung lassen sich Aufgaben in eine zeitliche Abfolge bringen. Dieses führt dazu, dass Zeitverschiebungen in der Ablaufkette sich auf die nachfolgenden Aufgaben auswirken. Kopiert nach / Kopiert von Stellt die Verbindung zwischen den Aufgaben her, die durch die Kopierfunktion angelegt wurden, bzw. die Vorlage für die Aufgabe sind. ➑ Alle Änderungen und Kommentierungen zur Aufgabe können, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, abgerufen werden. Es werden 3 Reiter angezeigt, Historie, Notizen und Eigenschaftsänderungen. Beim Anzeigen einer Aufgabe wird im Standard der Reiter Notiz aufgeblendet. In diesem Reiter werden eingefügte Kommentare dargestellt. Im Reiter Eigenschaftsänderungen werden dagegen alle Änderungen im Bereich des Aufgabenstatus, der Aufgabenbeschreibung und der Verknüpfungen dargestellt. Im Reiter Historie werden alle Änderungen chronologisch ungefiltert aufgelistet. Anwender können im Kommentarfeld direkt mit ihrem Namen angesprochen werden: Bei Eingabe des Zeichens @ werden Benutzernamen vorgeschlagen. Wird ein Anwender erwähnt, bekommt er eine E-Mail-Benachrichtigung darüber. ➒ Über den Button gelangt man in den Bearbeitungsmodus der Aufgabe. In diesem Bereich lassen sich die Attribute der Aufgabe anpassen. Bei der Bearbeitung der Aufgabe besteht die Möglichkeit Kommentare zu erstellen. Hierzu steht die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. Der Kommentar kann als Privat gekennzeichnet werden, so dass der Kommentar nur von dem Ersteller und berechtigten Nutzern (z.B. Admin) gelesen werden kann. ➓ Beobachter einer Aufgabe werden per E-Mail über Änderungen der Aufgabe informiert. Über den Button kann sich der Nutzer auf die Beobachterliste setzen bzw. mit dem Klick auf den Button die Beobachtung wieder einstellen. ⓫ Soll eine Aufgabe gleich oder ähnlich noch einmal durchgeführt werden, so kann die Aufgabe mit ihrer Konfiguration durch Betätigen des Buttons kopiert werden. Es erscheint das Formular, in dem die Grundeinstellungen von der Quellaufgabe übernommen wurden. In der Administration kann festgelegt werden, dass die kopierte Aufgabe mit der Quellaufgabe beim Kopiervorgang automatisch verknüpft wird. ⓬ Das 3-Punkte-Menü beinhaltet zwei Funktionen. Zum einen Link kopieren mit dem der Aufgabenlink in andere Anwendungen kopiert werden kann. Zum Anderen besteht die Auswahl, die Aufgabe zu löschen. ⓭ Die Aufgabe kann zum einen durch Klicken des Button als Atom-xml exportiert werden, um die Aufgabe in andere Systeme zu importieren. Zum Anderen kann mit Klicken des Buttons ein PDF erstellt werden, um die Informationen der Aufgabe außerhalb des Systems zu nutzen. In der Objektkonfiguration können einige Punkte für die Aufgaben in dem Objekt eingestellt werden. Dieses geschieht in der Objektkonfiguration in dem Reiter Aufgaben, in dem folgende Auswahlmöglichkeiten bestehen. Für die Aufgaben in dem Objekt kann die Auswahl der Aufgabentypen im Bereich Aufgabentyp eingeschränkt werden, es können die in den Aufgaben zur Verfügung stehenden Eigenen Felder eingeschränkt werden und es können das Standard-Paket und der Standardbearbeiter, die bei neuen Aufgaben dann automatisch gesetzt werden, definiert bzw. geändert werden. Änderungen müssen mit dem Button übernommen werden. Für die Strukturierung von Aufgaben stehen in dem Modul Aufgaben zwei Funktionen zur Verfügung. Die Aufgabenkategorien dienen im wesentlichen einer feineren Typisierung der Aufgabe und bietet damit einen Weg der automatisierten Aufgabenzuordnung. Die Aufgabenpakte fassen Aufgaben zusammen, die zu einem übergeordneten Thema gehören. Die Pakete können dabei auch objektübergreifend genutzt werden. Aufgabenkategorien müssen beim Anlegen des Objekts in der Konfiguration erstellt werden. Wird in der Objektkonfiguration der Reiter Aufgaben-Kategorien ausgewählt erscheint, wie unten zu sehen, die Übersichtsseite für die Aufgabenkategorie. In diesem Beispiel wurden bereits vier Kategorien angelegt. Jede Kategorie hat einen Namen und kann einem Mitglied oder einer Gruppe zugeordnet werden. Wenn die Kategorie einer neuen Aufgabe zugeordnet wird, wird die Aufgabe dem Mitglied bzw. der Gruppe zugewiesen, die in der Kategorie definiert wurde. Eine neue Kategorie kann durch Klicken des Buttons erstellt werden. Eine bestehende Kategorie kann über den Button bearbeitet werden. In beiden Varianten wird folgende Maske aufgeblendet. Der Name ist dabei ein Pflichtfeld, die Zuweisung optional. Durch den Button wird die Kategorie übernommen. Eine bestehende Kategorie wird über den Button in der Kategoriezeile gelöscht. Wenn die Kategorie bereits genutzt wird, erscheint folgende Maske: Hier kann der Anwender auswählen, ob in den Aufgaben mit der zu löschenden Kategorie entweder die Kategorie gelöscht wird oder eine andere Kategorie gesetzt werden soll. Über den Button kann der gewählte Prozess gestartet werden. Über den Button wird der Löschvorgang abgebrochen. Aufgabenpakete geben die Möglichkeit Aufgaben zu einem übergeordneten Thema zusammenzufassen. Das können z.B. Projekte oder Jahrgänge sein. Diese Zusammenfassung der Pakete in einem Objekt wird als Stapel dargestellt. Sobald ein Paket für ein Objekt zur Verfügung steht, wird im Objektmenü, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, der Reiter Stapel angezeigt. Wird der Reiter ausgewählt so werden die zur Verfügung stehenden Pakete mit den zugewiesenen Aufgaben aufgelistet. Neben dem Paketnamen ➊ wird der Status des Pakets ➋ und unterhalb (falls gepflegt) ein Umsetzungsende mit der verbleibenden Zeit ➌ dargestellt. Der Umsetzungsgrad ➍ (Fortschrittsbalken) des Pakets ermittelt sich automatisch aus den Umsetzungsgraden der zugeordneten Aufgaben. Unterhalb dieser Paketinformationen werden die dem Paket zugeordneten Aufgaben ➎ gelistet und durch Klick auf eine Aufgabe kann diese geöffnet werden. Über das 3-Punkte-Menü in der Aufgabenzeile können auch direkt die Aufgabeneigenschaften angepasst werden, die Aufgabe bearbeitet , gelöscht , kopiert , beobachtet oder eine Unteraufgabe hinzugefügt werden. Ein neues Paket kann über den Button ➐ Neues Paket erstellt werden. Es wird eine Erfassungsmaske eingeblendet. Eine Beschreibung ist im Abschnitt [Neues Paket]. Aufgabenpakete werden in der Konfiguration eines Objekts konfiguriert. In der Objektkonfiguration gelangt man über den Reiter Pakete in der Liste der in diesem Objekt erstellten Pakete. In der Liste der Pakete werden beim Öffnen die Pakete mit dem Status offen angezeigt. Der Filter kann für die Suche nach gesperrten oder abgeschlossen Pakete angepasst werden. Neues Paket Ein neues Paket kann über den Button ➐ Neues Paket erstellt werden. Hier wird die folgende Erfassungsmaske für ein Paket aufgerufen. Als Pflichtfeld muss ein Name vergeben werden. Weiter kann eine Beschreibung und wenn es im Wiki weiter Informationen gibt ein Link zur Wiki-Seite eingefügt werden. Das Datum gibt an, wann das Paket abgeschlossen sein soll. Die gemeinsame Verwendung gibt an, in welchen Objekten das erstellte Paket noch zur Verfügung steht. Zur Auswahl stehen folgende Einträge: Nicht gemeinsam verwenden Das Paket steht nur in dem Objekt zur Auswahl, in dem es erstellt wurde. Mit Unterobjekten Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit Objekthierarchie Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten sowie den übergeordneten Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit Objektbaum Das Paket steht neben dem Objekt, in dem es erstellt wurde, noch in allen Unterlagerten Objekten, den übergeordneten Objekten sowie den von den übergeordneten Objekten abzweigenden Objekten zur Verfügung. Mit allen Objekten Das Paket steht in allen Objekten zur Auswahl. Mit der Auswahl Standard-Paket kann festgelegt werden, dass bei einer neuen Aufgabe automatisch dieses Paket gesetzt wird. Mit dem Button wird das Paket gespeichert. Paket bearbeiten Über den Button in der Paketzeile kann das Paket bearbeitet werden. Es erscheint folgendes Formular, das in Großteilen dem Formular bei der Erstellung eines Pakets entspricht. Neu ist das Feld Status. Das Paket kann folgende Status annehmen: offen Das Paket kann für Aufgaben ausgewählt werden und wird im Stapel angezeigt. gesperrt Das Paket steht in Aufgaben nicht mehr zur Verfügung wird aber im Stapel angezeigt. abgeschlossen Das Paket steht in Aufgaben nicht zur Verfügung und wird nicht im Stapel angezeigt. Im Stapel können auch abgeschlossenen Pakete angezeigt werden, in dem über den Filter (wird über das Symbol am linken Bildschirmrand eingeblendet) geschlossene Pakete hinzugefügt werden. In der Bearbeitung von Objekten fehlt die Möglichkeit, das Paket als Standardpaket zu deklarieren. Dieses ist nach der Erstellung nur noch über die Aufgabenkonfiguration des Objekts möglich. Paket löschen Über den Button wird das Paket gelöscht und steht nicht weiter zur Verfügung. Das Löschen ist nur möglich, wenn keine Aufgabe mit dem Paket verbunden ist. Ist das der Fall, wird der Löschvorgang mit folgender Meldung abgebrochen. Vollständige Pakete schließen Mit dem Button werden alle Pakete, bei denen alle zugeordneten Aufgaben abgeschlossen sind, auf den Status abgeschlossen gesetzt. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgaben zu importieren. Der Import-Prozess kann in die Aufgabenübersicht und dort über die Auswahl im 3-Punkte-Menü gestartet werden. Formatvorgaben für die Importdatei Die zu importierenden Aufgaben müssen im CSV-Format vorliegen. In der ersten Zeile müssen die Attributbezeichnungen als Überschriften vorliegen. Die Attributbezeichnungen müssen nicht gleich denen im xmera Omnia sein. Bei Namensgleichheit können die Felder aber durch den Importmechanismus automatisch zugeordnet werden, so dass sich der Importvorgang vereinfacht. Es müssen in der Importdatei zumindest die Pflichtfelder vorhanden sein. Falls Attribute nicht vorhanden sind, bleiben diese Felder leer. In den Zeilen darunter sind zu importierenden Aufgaben mit den Attributwerten. Als Vorlage bietet sich ein Export von bereits erfassten Aufgaben an. Diese Datei kann dann als Vorlage für die zu importierenden Dateien dienen. Importprozess Der Importprozess startet mit der Auswahl der Importdatei. Über den Button Durchsuchen…​ kann die Importdatei über den Dateiexplorer ausgewählt werden. Durch wird der nächste Schritt aufgerufen. Jetzt werden die CSV-Optionen abgefragt. Hier geht es um die Trennzeichen, Textqualifizierer, Kodierung, Datumsformat und die Auswahlmöglichkeit, E-Mails für die importierten Aufgaben zu versenden. Im Regelfall ist die Kodierung anzupassen, da diese im Standard nicht UTF-8 ist, die im deutschen Raum üblich ist. Durch wird der nächste Schritt aufgerufen. In diesem Schritt erfolgt die Zuordnung der Aufgabenattribute zu den CSV-Attributen. Dieses erfolgt in der folgenden Maske: In dem Bereich Zuordnung der Felder wird in dem ersten Attribut festgelegt, in welche Objekt die Aufgaben importiert werden sollen. Danach folgen alle möglichen Attribute aufgelistet, die in Aufgaben vergeben werden können. Zu jedem Attribut, kann jetzt ein Feld aus der CSV-Datei zugeordnet werden. Alle erkannten Felder der CSV-Datei können über das Auswahlmenü zugeordnet werden. Als Orientierung ist im unteren Bereich eine Inhaltsvorschau, in der die erkannten Felder (Überschriften) und der Inhalt der ersten Aufgabe dargestellt werden. So weit möglich ordnet der Importprozess Felder bereits den Attributen imn xmera Omnia zu. In der Importdatei ist zu beachten, dass je nach gewähltem Aufgabentyp nicht alle Eigenen Felder zur Verfügung stehen. Sind im Aufgabenimport auch Verknüpfungen zwischen den importierten Aufgaben abgebildet, so sind die Zuordnungen im Bereich Zuweisung von Beziehungen zu pflegen. Mit dem Button gelangt man wieder zu den CSV-Optionen. Mit wird der Import gestartet. Importbericht Zum Abschluss des Importprozesses wird ein Importbericht dargestellt, in dem die Anzahl der importierten Aufgaben oder wie im folgenden Beispiel auf ein Importproblem hingewiesen wird.","title":"Aufgaben","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"aufgaben","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/aufgaben.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktion Aufgaben","hash":"_funktion_aufgaben","id":1},{"text":"Aufgabenübersicht","hash":"_aufgabenübersicht","id":2},{"text":"Aufgabenliste","hash":"_aufgabenliste","id":3},{"text":"Seitennavigation","hash":"_seitennavigation","id":4},{"text":"Filter","hash":"_filter","id":5},{"text":"Abfrage","hash":"_abfrage","id":6},{"text":"Neue Aufgabe","hash":"_neue_aufgabe","id":7},{"text":"Weitere Funktionen im 3-Punkte-Menü","hash":"_weitere_funktionen_im_3_punkte_menü","id":8},{"text":"Aufgabenexport","hash":"_aufgabenexport","id":9},{"text":"Aufgaben anlegen","hash":"_aufgaben_anlegen","id":10},{"text":"Objekt","hash":"_objekt","id":11},{"text":"Aufgabentyp","hash":"_aufgabentyp","id":12},{"text":"Thema","hash":"_thema","id":13},{"text":"Beschreibung","hash":"_beschreibung","id":14},{"text":"Status","hash":"_status","id":15},{"text":"Priorität","hash":"_priorität","id":16},{"text":"Zugewiesen an","hash":"_zugewiesen_an","id":17},{"text":"Übergeordnete Aufgabe","hash":"übergeordnete_aufgabe","id":18},{"text":"Beginn und Abgabedatum","hash":"_beginn_und_abgabedatum","id":19},{"text":"Geschätzter Aufwand","hash":"_geschätzter_aufwand","id":20},{"text":"% erledigt","hash":"_erledigt","id":21},{"text":"Eigene Felder","hash":"_eigene_felder","id":22},{"text":"Dateien (hochladen)","hash":"_dateien_hochladen","id":23},{"text":"Dokumente (DMS)","hash":"_dokumente_dms","id":24},{"text":"Beobachter","hash":"_beobachter","id":25},{"text":"Privat","hash":"_privat","id":26},{"text":"Anlegen / Anlegen und weiter","hash":"_anlegen_anlegen_und_weiter","id":27},{"text":"Aufgaben bearbeiten","hash":"_aufgaben_bearbeiten","id":28},{"text":"Aufgaben-ID","hash":"_aufgaben_id","id":29},{"text":"Aufgabenname","hash":"_aufgabenname","id":30},{"text":"Statusinformationen","hash":"_statusinformationen","id":31},{"text":"Aufgabenbeschreibung","hash":"_aufgabenbeschreibung","id":32},{"text":"Dateien","hash":"_dateien","id":33},{"text":"Unteraufgaben","hash":"unteraufgabe","id":34},{"text":"Zugehörige Aufgaben","hash":"_zugehörige_aufgaben","id":35},{"text":"Änderungsverfolgung und Kommentierung","hash":"_änderungsverfolgung_und_kommentierung","id":36},{"text":"Aufgabe bearbeiten","hash":"_aufgabe_bearbeiten","id":37},{"text":"Aufgabe beobachten","hash":"_aufgabe_beobachten","id":38},{"text":"Aufgabe kopieren","hash":"_aufgabe_kopieren","id":39},{"text":"3-Punkte-Menü","hash":"_3_punkte_menü","id":40},{"text":"Aufgabe abrufen","hash":"_aufgabe_abrufen","id":41},{"text":"Aufgaben konfigurieren","hash":"_aufgaben_konfigurieren","id":42},{"text":"Aufgaben strukturieren","hash":"_aufgaben_strukturieren","id":43},{"text":"Aufgabenkategorien","hash":"_aufgabenkategorien","id":44},{"text":"Aufgabenpakte","hash":"_aufgabenpakte","id":45},{"text":"Übersicht Aufgabenpakete","hash":"_übersicht_aufgabenpakete","id":46},{"text":"Aufgabenpakete verwalten","hash":"_aufgabenpakete_verwalten","id":47},{"text":"Aufgaben importieren","hash":"_aufgaben_importieren","id":48}]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"Wenn es keine öffentlichen Inhalte gibt, wird der Nutzer automatisch auf die Login-Seite geleitet.

Der gelb markierte Randbereich rechts und links wird je nach Größe des Browserfensters automatisch angepasst. Bei Bedarf kann der selbe Inhalt auch über die gesamte Seitenbreite angezeigt werden. Durch einen Klick auf das rote Plus-Symbol (rot umrandet im Bild oben) kann der Inhaltsbereich vergrößert werden. Das folgende Beispiel zeigt die gesamte Seitenbreite. Die Darstellung von Objekten und Aufgaben kann durch Filtern, Gruppieren und Tabellenspaltenauswahl an die Anforderungen der Nutzer angepasst und gespeichert werden. Das untere Bild zeigt den Filterbereich (grün umrandet) sowie weitere Optionen zum Gruppieren und zur Auswahl von Tabellenspalten (magenta umrandet) am Beispiel der Sicherheitsanforderungen. Auf diese Weise können individuelle Listen durch Abfragen (blau) gestaltet werden. So erhalten Nutzer verschiedenste Sichten auf die umfangreiche Datenbasis des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS) und damit einen schnellen Überblick. Über den Button wird der Filter wieder auf die Standard-Liste zurückgesetzt. Mit der xmera Omnia Philosophie \"Alle Assets sind Objekte und jede Maßnahme / Handlung ist eine Aufgabe\" läßt sich mit den Objekt- und Aufgabenlisten ein ISMS effizient gestalten. Objektliste Die Objektliste zeigt alle Objekte des Systems. Sie ist über das Topmenü erreichbar. Objekte werden in der Standardansicht entweder als Karten oder in Tabellenform angezeigt. Die Standardansicht wird im Administrationsbereich angepasst. Aufgabenliste Die Aufgabenliste listet alle Aufgaben des Objekts, in dem diese aufgerufen wurde, sowie die Aufgaben der unterlagerten Objekte. Dabei werden in der Standardliste nur die offenen Aufgaben angezeigt. Der Filterbereich einer Liste kann durch den Pfeil ausgeklappt und wieder eingeklappt werden. In den Zeilen des Filterbereichs werden die aktuell gewählten Einstellungen angezeigt. Die 1. Spalte (magenta) zeigt an, ob der Filter in der Zeile aktiv ist. Die 2. Spalte (grün) zeigt die Filterattribute. Die 3. Spalte (blau) zeigt die Filterregel an. Die 4. Spalte (rot) zeigt den Filterwert. Wie zu erkennen ist, ist der Aufbau einer Zeile an den Attributtyp angepasst. Auch der zur Verfügung stehende Regelsatz ist spezifisch für jeden Attributtyp. Im folgenden Beispiel ist der Regelsatz für ein Datum dargestellt. Die ausgewählten Regeln werden durch Klick auf den Button angewendet. Filter hinzufügen Im rechten oberen Bereich des Filterbereichs befindet sich das Auswahlfeld für Filter hinzufügen. Über das Auswahlfeld werden die zur Verfügung stehenden Attribute angezeigt. Durch Klick auf das gewünschte Filterattribut wird dieses der Filterliste hinzugefügt. Wird nach einem Attribut mit festen Werten gefiltert, so kann der gewünschte Wert ausgewählt werden. Durch Klick auf bzw. kann die Mehrfachauswahl aktiviert werden. Durch Drücken der STRG-Taste bei der Auswahl oder der SPACE-Taste und wählen des 1. und letzten Elements einer Auswahl, können mehrere Elemente gewählt werden. Die Darstellung der Mehrfachauswahl werden nur 4 Elemente dargestellt. Durch scrollen in der Liste werden weitere Elemente angezeigt. Die neu erstellte Regel wird durch Klick auf den Button angewendet. Filter löschen Zum Löschen einer Filterzeile ist diese über den Haken am Anfang der Zeile auf inaktiv zu setzen und anschließend auf den Filter anzuwenden. Mit dem Anwenden des Filters werden die auf inaktiv gesetzten Zeilen gelöscht. Karten / Liste Für Objekte besteht, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die Möglichkeit eine Kartenansicht zu wählen. In der Kartenansicht bestehen keine weiteren Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. Über den Karten gibt es noch den Button Alle einklappen/Alle ausklappen mit der in den Objektkarten die Unterobjekte ein- bzw. ausgeblendet werden. In der Listenansicht werden die Objekte tabellarisch dargestellt. In dieser Form ergeben sich, wie im folgenden zu sehen, weitere Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. Spaltenauswahl Über die Spaltenauswahl besteht die Möglichkeit die gewünschten Tabellenspalten festzulegen. Bei der Spaltenauswahl sind im linken Bereich die Verfügbaren Spalten und auf der rechten die Ausgewählten Spalten zu sehen. Durch markieren einer Verfügbaren Spalte und Klicken auf den werden die markierten Spalten in den Bereich Ausgewählte Spalten verschoben. Werden Spalten in der Liste Ausgewählte Spalten markiert, werden diese mit dem Klick auf den Button in die Liste Verfügbare Spalten verschoben. Die Reihenfolge der Ausgewählten Spalten wird durch die Tasten links von der Liste Ausgewählte Spalten gesteuert. Die markierten Objekte werden mit dem Klick ganz noch oben verschoben um eine Position nach oben verschoben um eine Position nach unten verschoben ganz nach unten verschoben Mit Klick auf den Button werden die Änderungen übernommen. Gruppierung Mit der Option Gruppieren kann die Liste nach einem definierten Attribut gruppieren. Im Beispiel wird die Liste nach dem Attribut Kapitel gruppiert. Über das Auswahlfeld im Bereich Gruppiere Ergebnisse nach werden die möglichen Gruppierungsattribute angezeigt. Mit Klick auf den Button werden die Änderungen übernommen. In der gruppierten Liste werden die Anzahl der Elemente pro Gruppe als rot hinterlegte Zahl dargestellt. Die Elemente der Gruppe können über Klicken auf den Pfeil eingeklappt bzw. über den Pfeil ausgeklappt werden. Summe Sind Zahlenwerte teil der Attribute, so kann man pro Gruppe auch den Summenwert darstellen. Der Summenwert wird in der Gruppenzeile dargestellt. Anzeigen Mit der Option Anzeigen können ausgewählte Felder vom Typ Langtext in eine Zeile mit eingeblendet werden. In der Liste werden unterhalb der Spaltenwerte die ausgewählten Texte (im Beispiel oben der Text der Bemerkung) angezeigt. Sortierungen In welcher Form die Liste sortiert wird, wird über das Symbol für aufsteigend bzw. für absteigend sortiert links neben der Spaltenüberschrift der Spalte, nach der sortiert wurde, dargestellt. Durch einen Klick auf dieselbe Spaltenüberschrift wird die Sortierrichtung geändert. Durch Klick auf eine andere Spaltenüberschrift wird dann nach dieser Spalte sortiert. Eine Mehrfachsortierung ist über eine Abfrage möglich. Eine Abfrage in xmera Omnia ist eine gespeicherte Zusammenstellung von Filtern, Darstellungsoptionen und Sortierungen. Es wird dabei zwischen eigenen Abfragen, den Benutzerdefinierten Abfragen, und Abfragen für die Allgemeinheit unterschieden. Benutzerdefinierte Abfragen stehen nur dem Benutzer, der sie erstellt hat, zur Verfügung. Abfragen aufrufen Die für die Liste zur Verfügung stehenden Abfragen werden in der linken Sidebar angezeigt. Ist eine Abfrage aus der Sidebar aktiv, wird sie weiß hinterlegt dargestellt. Im Bild oben ist das die Abfrage Sicherheitsanforderungen (offen). Durch einen Klick auf das X neben der aktiven Abfrage wird diese geschlossen und die Liste auf den Standard (alle offenen Aufgaben aus Objekt und Unterobjekten) zurückgesetzt. Durch Klick auf eine andere Anfrage in der Sidebar öffnet die gewählte Abfrage. Abfrage erstellen Eine Abfrage wird erstellt, in dem eine Liste mit den gewünschten Filter- und Gestalungsoptionen erstellt, angewendet und diese anschließend gespeichert wird. Nachdem eine Liste erstellt wurde, erscheint der Button . Wird das Speichern geklickt, erscheint der Konfigurationsdialog. Minimal ist der Name der Abfrage festzulegen. Im Folgenden kann die Abfrage allen Nutzern oder auch nur bestimmten Rollen verfügbar gemacht werden. Wird der Haken Für alle Objekte nicht gesetzt, steht die Abfrage nur in dem erstellten Objekt zur Auswahl. Anschließend können in dieser Maske weitere Filter-, Sortier- und Spalteneinstellungen vorgenommen werden. Bei den Sortierung besteht in der Maske auch die Möglichkeit mehrstufig in bis zu drei Stufen zu sortieren. Mit Klick auf den Button wird die Abfrage gespeichert und es erscheint die gewünschte Liste. Eine Abfrage, die in allen Objekten aktiviert wurde, kann nach dem Speichern nicht mehr auf ein Objekt eingeschränkt werden. Die Abfrage muss neu erstellt und die nicht gewünschte Abfrage gelöscht werden. Abfrage bearbeiten Um eine Abfrage bearbeiten zu können, ist diese zunächst aufzurufen. Anschließend kommt man durch den Klick auf den Button in die Eigenschaftsmaske der Abfrage, in der die Filter und Gestaltungsoptionen angepasst werden können. Mit dem Speichern werden die Anpassungen übernommen und die geänderte Abfrage aufgerufen. Abfrage löschen Zum Löschen einer Anfrage ist die zu löschende Abfrage zu öffnen. Durch Klicken auf den Button wird nach Bestätigung in einer Sicherheitsabfrage die Anfrage gelöscht.","title":"Bediengrundlagen","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"bediengrundlagen","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/bediengrundlagen.html","titles":[{"text":"Anmeldung","hash":"_anmeldung","id":1},{"text":"Anwendungsmenüs","hash":"_anwendungsmenüs","id":2},{"text":"Bedienoptionen","hash":"_bedienoptionen","id":3},{"text":"Suchen / Schnellnavigation","hash":"_suchen_schnellnavigation","id":4},{"text":"Breite des Inhaltsbereichs anpassen","hash":"_breite_des_inhaltsbereichs_anpassen","id":5},{"text":"Objekt- und Aufgabenlisten","hash":"_objekt_und_aufgabenlisten","id":6},{"text":"Filtereinstellungen","hash":"_filtereinstellungen","id":7},{"text":"Gestaltungsoptionen","hash":"_gestaltungsoptionen","id":8},{"text":"Persistente Abfragen","hash":"_persistente_abfragen","id":9}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Mein Konto enthält Einstellungsmöglichkeiten, aus denen ein Anwender für sich wählen kann.

Ist ein Dokument gesperrt, so wird im Datumsfeld das Symbol angehängt und die Buttons für das Sperren werden zum Button . Über die Button kann das Dokument wieder entsperrt werden. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit in der Administration eigene Felder zu jedem Dokument hinzuzufügen. Zum Beispiel sind es hier, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die Vertraulichkeitsklasse und der Bearbeitungsstatus. Diese eigenen Felder ermöglichen weitere Klassifizierungs- und Strukturierungsmöglichkeiten, nach denen in der Dokumentenliste auch gefiltert / gruppiert werden kann. Durch eine Ordnerstruktur lassen sich die Dokumente in der Dokumentenliste strukturieren. Im DMS lassen sich in jedem Ordner Berechtigungen vergeben, die es ermöglichen, einzelne Ordner nur einer eingegrenzten Nutzergruppe zugänglich zu machen. Angelegt werden Ordner über Klicken des Buttons . Es erscheint folgende Erfassungsmaske: Neben dem Datum kann eine Beschreibung, sowie weiter individuelle Einträge (eigenen Felder) dem Ordner zugeordnet werden. Weiter können die Zugriffe auf den Ordner durch die Auswahlfelder im Bereich Zugriff erlaubt für eingeschränkt werden.

Benutzer werden zunächst nicht angezeigt. Durch Klicken auf den Button können Benutzer / Gruppen des Objekts hinzugefügt werden. Durch Klicken auf den Ordnernamen in der Dokumentenliste gelangt man in die Liste des Ordners. Angezeigt wird der aktuelle Ordner in der Zeile unterhalb des Objektmenüs. In dem Beispiel oben ist es Dateien / Protokolle / Lenkungskreis. Durch Klicken auf den Ordnernamen in der Ordnerstruktur kann man direkt in die Dokumentenliste des entsprechenden Ordners springen. Neue Dokumente werden immer dem Ordner zugeordnet, von dem aus eine neue Datei hinzugefügt wird. Eine Datei, aber auch ein ganzer Ordner lassen sich im Nachgang auch verschieben oder kopieren. Im 3-Punkte-Menu in der Zeile des Ordner oder der Datei, die verschoben werden soll, wählt man den Button . Es erscheint folgende Maske: In der Maske kann das Zielobjekt und der Zielordner gewählt werden, in das das Dokument/Ordner verschoben bzw. kopiert werden soll. Die Auswahl, ob es sich um eine Kopie oder ob es ich um ein Verschieben handelt, wird durch Klicken auf den Button oder festgelegt. Ein Ordner kann mit der Funktion im 3-Punkte-Menu in der Zeile des Ordners, der gelöscht werden soll, durchgeführt werden. Mit dem Genehmigungs-Workflow bietet xmera Omnia die Möglichkeit Genehmigungsprozesse für Dokumente abzubilden. Hierzu wird ein Workflow festgelegt, in welchen Schritten die Genehmigung zu erfolgen hat der Workflow einem Dokument zugeordnet, der Freigabeprozess gestartet und die Freigabe im Dokument gespeichert. Diese Schritte werden im Folgenden beschrieben. Grundsätzlich werden globale und lokale Workflows unterschieden. Globale Workflows werden im Administrationsbereich von xmera Omnia erstellt und stehen in allen Objekten zur Verfügung. Die lokalen Workflows werden im Konfigurationsbereich des Objekts erstellt und stehen nur dem Objekt zur Verfügung. Die Erstellung eines Workflows ist in beiden Fällen gleich. Die Erstellung und Pflege von lokaler Genehmigungs-Workflows erfolgt in der Objektkonfiguration im Reiter Genehmigungs-Workflow. Hier finden sich die für das Objekt definierten Workflows. Es können über den Button ein neuer Workflow erstellt, durch Klicken auf den Namen des Workflows in der Liste der Workflow bearbeitet werden oder durch Klicken auf der lokale Workflow gelöscht werden. Ein Workflow kann gelöscht werden, obwohl er bereits einem Dokument zugeordnet wurde. Dieses führt zur Fehlern, die nicht über die Anwendung zu reparieren sind. Wird ein neuer Workflow erstellt, so erscheint folgende Maske: Hier wird der Name des Workflows festgelegt und es kann optional als Vorlage ein bestehender Workflow gewählt werden. Mit dem Button oder durch Bearbeiten eines bestehenden Workflows gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsmaske des Workflows. In dieser Maske kann zum einen der Name des Workflows verändert werden und es können die Workflow Schritte bearbeitet werden. Der Ablauf des Workflows erfolgt in Schritten. Es werden die Genehmiger des 1. Schritts zur Genehmigung/Ablehnung aufgefordert werden. Ist dieser Schritt genehmigt, wird der die Genehmiger des folgenden Schritts zur Genehmigung/Ablehnung aufgefordert. Sind alle Schritte genehmigt, so wird das Dokument als genehmigt klassifiziert. Mit dem Button wird eine Maske geöffnet, mit der Objektmitglieder einem neuen oder einem bestehenden Schritt hinzugefügt werden können. Hier müssen als erstes die Mitglieder der Gruppe gewählt werden, die dem Bearbeitungsschritt zugeordnet werden sollen. Als nächstes ist der Schritt zu wählen, dem diese Mitglieder zugeordnet werden sollen. Bei der Erstellung eines neuen Schritts ist der Name des Schritts neben dem Auswahlfeld zu setzen. Mit dem Wählen der Auswahl UND oder ODER wird der Schritt erstellt bzw. geändert. Alle Mitglieder die mit einem UND dem Schritt zugeordnet sind müssen den Schritt genehmigen, damit der Schritt abgeschlossen sind. Alle Mitglieder die mit ODER dem Schritt zugeordnet sind, sind optional. Sind nur Mitglieder mit ODER dem Schritt zugeordnet, muss zur Freigabe des Schritts mindestens ein Mitglied den Schritt freigeben. Über den Button können weitere Schritte hinzugefügt werden. Die Bearbeitung teilt sich in drei Aspekte auf: Neue Mitglieder zu einem Schritt hinzufügen Mitgliederfunktionen ändern oder löschen Reihenfolge der Schritte verändern Neue Mitglieder werden über den Prozess in einen neuen Schritt eingebunden. Der Ablauf entspricht dem Vorgehen beim Erstellen eines neuen Schrittes. Bei dem Hinzufügen wird der Schritt ausgewählt, in dem das Mitglied bzw. die Mitglieder hinzugefügt werden sollen. Soll die Auswahl UND / ODER für ein Mitglied verändert werden oder soll ein Mitglied aus einem Schritt entfernt werden, so geht man über den Button in der Zeile des zu bearbeitenden Schritts. Es öffnet sich die Zeile im Bearbeitungsmodus. Hier kann der Name des Schritts angepasst werden, pro Mitglied die Option UND bzw. ODER verändert werden oder das Mitglied gelöscht werden. Mit dem Button Wechseln wird die Änderung übernommen und mit Abbrechen verworfen. Die Reihenfolge der Schritte kann über eine Drag & Drop Funktion verändert werden. Mit gehaltener linker Maustaste auf das Symbol kann die gewählte Zeile verschoben werden. An der Stelle, an der die Maus gelöst wird, wird der Schritt hin verschoben. Um einen Workflow zu starten, muss der Workflow zunächst dem Dokument zugeordnet werden. Dieses erfolgt über den Punkt Workflow starten im 3-Punkte-Menü der Dokumentenzeile. Es erscheint ein Fenster, in dem der für die Freigabe benötigte Workflow ausgewählt wird. Es ist per Dropdown-Menü ein Workflow auszuwählen. Mit OK wird der gewählte Workflow dem Dokument zugeordnet. Anschließend muss für die Durchführung des Workflowprozess dieser gestartet werden. Hierzu wird wiederum über das 3-Punkte-Menü über den Menüpunkt Start der Prozess gestartet. Der aktuelle Status des Workflowprozesses erscheint durch Klicken auf den Status des Workflows. Es wird die Darstellung des Workflowporzesses mit den einzelnen Schritten angezeigt. Ist der Freigabeprozess gestartet wird allen Mitgliedern des 1. Schritt auf \"Meine Seite\" die offenen Genehmigungsworkflows angezeigt. Weiter wird xmera Omnia auch eine E-Mail an die Freigeber des Schritts gesendet. Eine Freigabe ist im DMS am freizugebenden Dokument möglich.

Eine ihrer Hauptaufgabe ist die Bereitstellung des Assetsregisters im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS). Objekte zeichnen sich durch folgende Eigenschaften aus: Objekte können hierarchisch strukturiert werden, Objekten können Mitglieder mit Rollen zugeordnet werden, Objekte können Funktionsmodule bereitstellen, Objekte gehören einer Objektklasse an, Objekte können mit anderen Objekten logisch verknüpft werden. Die Übersicht der Objekte wird im Topmenü über den Menüpunkt Objekte aufgerufen. Jeder Anwender sieht die öffentlichen Objekte und die Objekte, in denen er eine Rolle zugewiesen bekommen hat. Die Objektdaten werden in der Objektübersicht dargestellt (siehe Kasten 3 im nachfolgenden Bild): ➊ Objektbezeichung (Hierarchiepfad und Objektname) ➋ Objektbeschreibung ➌ Spezifische Objektdaten (Eigene Felder) ➍ Aufgaben ➎ Mitglieder des Objekts mit ihren Rollen ➏ Unterobjekte (Hierarchie) ➐ Verknüpfte Objekte (logische Zusammenhänge) Die Objekthierarchie bietet die Möglichkeit Arbeitsbereiche, Verantwortlichkeiten/Organisationen als auch Sicherheitszonen/Cluster strukturiert darzustellen. Die hierarchische Struktur wird durch die Festlegung des übergeordneten Objekts bei der Erstellung/Konfiguration des Objekts definiert. So entsteht ein Objektbaum, der sich in der Listenanzeige der Objektübersicht darstellen läßt. In der Objektübersicht wird die Struktur in der Objektbezeichung, wie im nachfolgenden Bild an Pkt. ➊ zu sehen, mit den Links zu den übergeordneten Objekten dargestellt. In dem Bereich Unterobjekte ➋ sind die dem Objekt unterlagerten Objekte zu sehen und verlinkt. Neben der hierarchischen Verknüpfung der Objekte bietet xmera Omnia noch die logische Objektverknüpfung. Die Verknüpfung dient der Abbildung von Beziehungsstrukturen. Diese werden im Rahmen der Schutzbedarfsfeststellung für die automatische Vererbung benötigt. Daher bilden die Verknüpfungen eines Objekts die logischen Verbindungen zu Diensten anderer Objekte ab. Beispiele für solche Verknüpfungen sind Prozess nutzt Anwendung, Client nutzt Server oder Server steht im Serverraum. Die Festlegung der Objektverknüpfung erfolgt in der Objektkonfiguration. Die Verwaltung von Mitgliedern und deren Rollen ist nicht zentral für die Anwendung definiert, sondern erfolgt in jedem Objekt einzeln. Zentral verwaltet werden die Benutzer des Systems, also diejenigen, die Mitglieder von Objekten werden können, die Gruppen und die Zuordnung der Benutzer zu den Gruppen, als auch die Rollen und Rechte, die in der Anwendung genutzt werden können. Jedem Mitglied bzw. jeder Gruppe von Benutzern ist mindestens eine Rolle zugewiesen. Damit sind die Rechte jedes Mitglieds eindeutig definiert. Eine Sonderrolle spielen öffentliche Objekte. Wird ein Objekt als öffentlich parametriert, so können auch Nichtmitglieder und anonyme Benutzer (nicht angemeldet) Rechte im Objekt erhalten. Diese Rechte sind in den Rollen Nichtmitglied und Anonym definiert. Objekte können aus der Objektseite (siehe Bild) als auch, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, aus jeder Objektübersichtsseite als Unterobjekt angelegt werden. Wird die Auswahl Neues Objekt oder Neues Unterobjekt nicht angezeigt, so fehlt dem Anwender das entsprechende Recht. Es wird dann die Konfigurationsmaske des neuen Objekts geöffnet. Die wichtigsten Punkte werden in den folgenden Unterkapiteln beschrieben. Die mit * gekennzeichneten Felder sind Pflichtfelder und müssen ausgefüllt werden. Über eine CSV-Schnittstelle können Objekte in großer Zahl in xmera Omnia eingebracht werden. Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass entsprechend vorkonfigurierte Objektklassen bestehen. Der Objektimport erfolgt in 5 Schritten: Importdatei vorbereiten Eine für den Import von Objekten geeignete Importdatei muss folgende Daten beinhalten: Spaltenbezeichnung Datentyp Beschreibung Beispiel Name String Name des zu erzeugenden Objekts. (Pflichtfeld) Softwareentwicklung Beschreibung String Beschreibung des zu erzeugenden Objekts. (Optional) Entwicklung von Standardsoftware zur Produktionssteuerung Kennung String Kennung des zu erzeugenden Objekts: Länge zwischen 1 und 100 Zeichen. Kleinbuchstaben (a-z), Ziffern, Binde- und Unterstriche erlaubt. (Pflichtfeld) softwareentwicklung Öffentlich Boolean Soll das Objekt für alle Systembenutzer ohne Mitgliedschaft zugänglich sein? (Standard: false) false Unterobjekt von String Kennung des gewünschten Elternobjektes. (Pflichtfeld) prozess-informationen Benutzer erben Boolean Das zu erzeugende Objekt bekommt die selben Benutzer wie das Elternobjekt. (Optional) false Objektklasse String Kennung der Objektklasse, von der das zu erzeugende Objekt abgeleitet werden soll. (Pflichtfeld) okm-prozess [Objekt-Eigenes-Feld] [Feldtyp] [Objekt-Eigenes-Feld] = Name des eigenen Felds, das in der Objektlasse des erzeugenden Objekts definiert ist. [Feldtyp] hängt vom eigenen Feld ab und bestimmt den Wert. (Optional) Für ein Beispiel siehe Bild Feldzuordnung. Importdatei hochladen Der Einstiegspunkt für den Import von Objekten ist über das Topmenü durch Klick auf den Menüpunkt Objekte erreichbar. Wenn auf der Objektseite das 3-Punkte-Menü aufgeklappt wird, erscheint der Menüpunkt Importieren. Das Hochladen kann per Auswahl über den Dateimanager oder per Drag & Drop erfolgen. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um zu den CSV-Optionen zu kommen. CSV Optionen definieren Die konkrete Wahl der CSV Optionen hängt davon ab, wie die CSV-Datei erstellt wurde. Für die Kodierung ist im Normalfall UTF-8 die beste Wahl. Dann auf Weiter klicken, um die Datenfelder zuordnen zu können. Datenfelder zuordnen Wenn die Importdatei gut vorbereitet wurde, konnten alle Datenfelder automatisch zugeordnet werden. Andernfalls, muss eine manuelle Zuordnung durchgeführt werden. Dann auf Importieren klicken, um den Import zu starten Import durchführen Während des Imports kann anhand des Zählers der Importfortschritt beobachtet werden. Wenn der Import erfolgreich verlief, wird eine Liste der neuen Objekte angezeigt. Andernfalls erhält der Benutzer entsprechende Fehlermeldungen wie beispielhaft unten im Bild zu sehen ist. Der Importprozess wird nicht abgebrochen, wenn eine Zeile der CSV-Datei nicht fehlerfrei in ein Objekt überführt werden kann. Die nicht importierten Zeilen werden in Form ihrer Positionsnummer in der Fehlermeldung angezeigt und müssen separat in einem zweiten Versuch importiert werden. Objektklassen beschreiben einen typischen Aufbau eines Objekts. Dieser Aufbau wird im Objektklassen Master durch den Administrator gepflegt. Anpassbar sind beispielsweise Metadaten zu einem Objekt/Asset, Schutzbedarfsfeststellungen für Prozesse oder Informationsobjekte, Sicherheitsanforderungen, Gefährdungen, Standardaufgaben, Wiederkehrende Aufgaben, Wiki-Inhalte Tabellen wie bspw. Gerätelisten, Raumlisten, usw. diverse Aufgabenformulare, Kalender und Gantt-Diagramm, usw. Objektklassen werden zusätzlich als Parameter in einigen Objektmodulen und globalen Systemeinstellungen benötigt. Beispiele hierfür sind das Modul Aufgaben, Aufgaben-Synchronisation und das Modul Tabellen. Die Vorkonfiguration wird nach dem ersten Speichern beim Anlegen eines neuen Objekts an dieses übertragen. Die Vorkonfiguration von Objektklassen erfolgt aus der Administration der Anwendung. Wird ein Objekt von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet müssen lediglich die Pflichtfelder, Unterobjekt von und Benutzer erben ausgefüllt werden. Wird ein Objekt nicht von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet, erfolgt die Objektkonfiguration manuell. Objekte, die Asstes darstellen, müssen von einer Objektklasse abgeleitet werden, da die Schutzbedarfvererbung auf das Konzept der Objektklassen angewiesen ist! Der Objektname sollte ein Objekt möglichst gut beschreiben. Der Name kann nachträglich noch geändert werden. Beim Schreiben des Namens wird bei der ersten Einrichtung des Objekts automatisch die Kennung erstellt. Diese kann vor dem ersten Speichern geändert werden. Die Kennung muss eindeutig sein, darf keine Sonderzeichen und Umlaute enthalten und muss ausschließlich aus Kleinbuchstaben, optional mit Ganzzahlen kombiniert, bestehen. Wurde das Objekt gespeichert, kann die Kennung nicht mehr verändert werden! Die Objektbeschreibung ermöglicht es, einen längeren, das Objekt beschreibenden Text, Grafiken, Links u.ä. dem Objekt mitzugeben. Die Objektbeschreibung wird in der Objektübersicht unterhalb der Objektbezeichung dargestellt. Zur Erstellung der Beschreibung steht dem Anwender die Wiki-Toolbar zur Verfügung. Mögliche Textauszeichnungssprachen sind Markdown und Textile. Welcher Editor verwendet werden soll, muss im Administrationsbereich festgelegt werden. Dabei kann auch gänzlich auf eine Textauszeichnung verzichtet werden. Das Feld Objekt-Homepage bietet eine Möglichkeit einen externen Link auf einer Objektseite zu erfassen. Der Link wird oberhalb der Objektdaten auf der Übersichtsseite dargestellt. Mit setzen des Feldes wird das Objekt öffentlich. Alle Nutzer, die Zugang zu xmera Omnia haben, können Informationen des Objekts sehen. Ein nicht angemeldeter Nutzer ist automatisch mit den Rechten der Rolle Anonym ausgestattet. Jeder angemeldete Benutzer erhält automatisch die Rollenrechte der Rolle Nichtmitglied. Der Administrator kann in der Konfiguration vorgeben, dass eine Anmeldung zwingend notwendig ist. Damit wird verhindert, dass nicht autorisierte Nutzer mit dem System arbeiten können. Durch die Zuordnung des Objekts zu einem überlagerten Objekt wird der Hierarchiebaum erstellt. Wird ein Unterobjekt erstellt, ist dieses Feld bereits vorbelegt, kann aber geändert werden. Mit Setzen des Feldes werden die Mitglieder mit ihren Rollen aus dem übergeordneten Objekt übernommen. xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit Objekten Eigene Felder zuzufügen. Die eigenen Felder werden durch den Administrator bereitgestellt und in der Konfigurationsmaske des Objekts gepflegt. Die Darstellung erfolgt in der Tabelle der spezifischen Objektdaten. Die Verknüpfungen basieren auf den Objektklassen. In der Konfiguration einer Objektklassen wird festgelegt, welche Objektklassen Dienste anbieten, die von anderen Objektklassen genutzt werden. In der Konfiguration des Objekts werden dann die konkreten Objektverknüpfungen festgelegt. Das Objekt mit seiner Objektklasse muss, damit die Objektverküpfungen aktiviert werden können, im xmera Omnia bekannt sein. Damit wird die Auswahl erst nach dem ersten Speichern des Objekts angezeigt. Das folgende Bild zeigt die Konfigurationsmaske eines Beispielobjekts. Zu sehen sind die bereitgestellten Dienste (Objekte einer Objektklasse), die mit dem Objekt in der Konfiguration verknüpft werden können. Objektmodule sind die Werkzeuge im xmera Omnia. Nicht in jedem Objekt werden alle Module benötigt. Damit die Anwendung nicht zu unübersichtlich wird, können die Module zu jedem Objekt ein und ausgeschaltet werden. Ein Beispiel ist im folgenden Bild zu sehen: Die aktivierten Module werden als Reiter in den Objektmasken angezeigt. Für die oben dargestellte Auswahl ergibt sich dann folgende Menüleiste: Wird ein Modul deaktiviert, in dem bereits Daten erfasst wurden, so werden die bereits erfassten Daten nicht gelöscht. Wird das Modul wieder aktiviert, so werden diese Daten wieder angezeigt. Über den Reiter Mitglieder der Konfigurationsseite eines Objekts lassen sich Mitgliederrollen verwalten. In der Liste sind, siehe Punkt ➊, alle Mitglieder und Gruppen mit ihren Rollen gelistet. Über den Button ➋ können neue Mitglieder mit aufgenommen werden und mit der Bearbeitung bzw. dem Löschen ➌ lassen sich die Einträge verändern oder entfernen. Nutzern mit Administrationsrechten wird der Button Administration ➍ angeboten. Über diesen Button kommt der Administrator direkt in die Benutzerverwaltung. Aus einem überlagerten Objekt geerbte Mitglieder und deren Rollen können nicht gelöscht werden. Es können nur weitere Mitglieder oder Rollen hinzugefügt werden und nur diese Einträge lassen sich auch wieder löschen. Sollen neue Mitglieder hinzugefügt werden, wird ein weiteres Fenster mit den möglichen Mitgliedern und Gruppen sowie die Liste der möglichen Rollen angezeigt. Für die Aufnahme von Mitgliedern sind die Benutzer bzw. die Gruppen auszuwählen, die aufgenommen werden sollen. Weiter ist die Rolle bzw. sind die Rollen auszuwählen, die Mitglieder in diesem Objekt haben sollen. Nur in der Kombination aus Benutzer/Gruppe mit der/den Rolle(n) können neue Mitglieder durch Klicken des Buttons Hinzufügen aufgenommen werden. Sollen Rollen eines Mitglieds oder einer Gruppe verändert werden, so erfogt das über den Button Bearbeiten. Es wird der Listeintrag des ausgewählten Mitarbeiters aufgeklappt und durch An- oder Abwahl können die Rollen verändert werden. Rollen, die ein Mitglied von einer Gruppe oder dem vorgelagerten Objekt geerbt hat, können nicht verädert werden. Dieses ist in der Maske gekennzeichnet. Werden alle Rollen eines Mitglieds gelöscht, wird dieses Mitglied gelöscht. Das Journal eines Objekts zeigt die Aktivitäten von ausgewählten Modulen chronologisch an. Beim Standardaufruf werden die letzten 10 Tage bis zum aktuellen Datum angezeigt. Das Datum kann durch den Nutzer geändert werden. Die Anzahl der Tage, im Standard 10, die chronologisch dargestellt werden, kann in der Systemkonfiguration angepasst werden. In der Sidebar besteht die Möglichkeit die Aktivitäten zu filtern. So können die Aktivitäten durch Auswahl der Module, die betrachtet werden sollen, eingeschränkt werden. Weiter können die angezeigten Aktivitäten auf eine Person eingegrenzt werden. Änderungen werden mit dem Button Anwenden übernommen. Die Liste der Aktivitäten wird danach neu aufgebaut. Die Aktivitäten sind als Links dargestellt, so dass direkt zu den Änderungen gesprungen werden kann.","title":"Objekte","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"objekte","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/objekte.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktion der Objekte","hash":"_funktion_der_objekte","id":1},{"text":"Objektübersicht","hash":"_objektübersicht","id":2},{"text":"Objekthierarchie","hash":"_objekthierarchie","id":3},{"text":"Objektverknüpfungen","hash":"_objektverknüpfungen","id":4},{"text":"Objektmitglieder","hash":"_objektmitglieder","id":5},{"text":"Objekte erstellen","hash":"_objekte_erstellen","id":6},{"text":"Objekte manuell erstellen","hash":"_objekte_manuell_erstellen","id":7},{"text":"Objekte importieren","hash":"_objekte_importieren","id":8},{"text":"Objekte konfigurieren","hash":"_objekte_konfigurieren","id":9},{"text":"Objektklassen","hash":"_objektklassen","id":10},{"text":"Objektname","hash":"_objektname","id":11},{"text":"Objektkennung","hash":"_objektkennung","id":12},{"text":"Objektbeschreibung","hash":"_objektbeschreibung","id":13},{"text":"Objekt-Homepage","hash":"_objekt_homepage","id":14},{"text":"Öffentlich","hash":"_öffentlich","id":15},{"text":"Unterobjekt von","hash":"_unterobjekt_von","id":16},{"text":"Benutzer erben","hash":"_benutzer_erben","id":17},{"text":"Objektdaten","hash":"_objektdaten","id":18},{"text":"Objektverknüpfungen","hash":"_objektverknüpfungen_2","id":19},{"text":"Objektmodule","hash":"_objektmodule","id":20},{"text":"Mitglieder verwalten","hash":"_mitglieder_verwalten","id":21},{"text":"Objektjournal","hash":"_objektjournal","id":22}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"Tabellen dienen im xmera Omnia der Erfassung von Listen, die zum einen der Dokumentation dienen können, wie z.B.

Der Tabellenaufbau, das heißt die einzelnen Tabellenspalten und ggf. die Berechnungen werden durch den Administrator festgelegt. Der Anwender legt dann Datenblätter an, die auf den administrierten Tabellen basieren. Ist das Modul Tabellen in einem Objekt aktiviert, kommt der Anwender durch Klicken auf den Menüpunkt Tabellen auf die Übersichtsseite der Tabellen. Auf der Übersichtsseite werden die bereits bestehenden Datenblätter als Kacheln und in der Sidebar (die durch den roten Pfeil ein- und ausgeklappt werden kann) dargestellt.

Die Berechnungen sind durch die Administration zu definieren. Wenn solch eine Berechnung für die Tabelle angelegt ist, wird das Berechnungsergebnis oberhalb der Tabelle angezeigt. Das Beispiel zeigt eine Schutzbedarfsfeststellung, bei der die Werte aller Zeilen der Tabelle nach dem Maximumprinzip zusammengefasst werden. xmera Omnia bietet an Berechnungsergebnisse an assoziierte Objekte zu vererben. Assoziierte Objekte sind Objekte dessen Klassen in Klient-Service-Beziehung zueinander stehen. Diese Beziehungen werden im Administrationsbereich in den Objektklassen festgelegt. Die Vererbungsfunktion wird im Administrationsbereich mit der Option Ergebnisse von assoziierten Objekten vererben aktiviert. Die Ergebnisse der Schutzbedarffeststellung von assoziierten Objekten (hier Klienten) werden im unteren Teil der nachstehenden Abbildung angezeigt. Hieraus errechnet sich das Ergebnis wie im mittleren Teil zu sehen. Für das Beispiel Schutzbedarf wurde für die Berechnung das Maximum konfiguriert. Der obere Teil in der Abbildung zeigt das Endergebnis. Der verantwortliche Mitarbeiter kann das berechnete Ergebnis übernehmen oder anpassen. In beiden Fällen muss das Endergebnis begründet werden. Erst mit der Übernahme oder der manuellen Anpassung steht das Ergebnis den verknüpften Objekten zur Verfügung und wird vererbt.

Die Informationen zur Bearbeitung sind dem Kapitel Wiederholende Aufgaben erstellen zu entnehmen.","title":"Wiederholende Aufgaben","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"wiederholende-aufgaben","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/wiederholende-aufgaben.html","titles":[{"text":"Wiederholende Aufgaben erstellen","hash":"_wiederholende_aufgaben_erstellen","id":1},{"text":"Wiederholende Aufgaben bearbeiten","hash":"_wiederholende_aufgaben_bearbeiten","id":2}]},"73":{"id":73,"text":"In einem Wiki lassen sich hervorragend Erfahrungen und Wissen gemeinschaftlich sammeln. In xmera Omnia kann das Wiki in jedem Objekt aktiviert werden. Zu den wichtigsten Funktionen gehören: Textformatierung, Grafiken und Bilder hochladen, Grafiken selbst erzeugen, Wiki-Makros ausführen. Die Wikigestaltung wird durch die Wiki-Toolbar, mit der die Texte formatiert werden können, und der Möglichkeit Bilder und Grafiken einzubinden, unterstützt. Zum Erstellen von Grafiken muss die Drawio-Integration im Administrationsbereich konfiguriert worden sein. Ist das Modul Wiki für das Objekt aktiviert, so kann das Objekt-Wiki über den Menüpunkt Wiki geöffnet werden. Ist noch keine Wikiseite gespeichert, so wird die erste Seite des neuen Wikis im Bearbeitungsmodus geöffnet. In xmera Omnia wird als Auszeichnungssprache Markdown empfohlen. Markdown ist eine sehr einfache Auszeichnungssprache, die die Textformatierung unterstützt. Über die Administration kann die Anwendung auch auf Textile umgestellt werden. Für die Textformatierung steht eine Toolbar zur Verfügung. Das Ergebnis kann man sich über die Vorschau anschauen. Jede Anpassung kann kommentiert werden. Damit hat man in der Veränderungshistorie des Wiki die Möglichkeit, Änderungen leichter nachzuvollziehen. Mit Klick auf den Button wird die aktuelle Seite gespeichert. Es erscheint die Wiki-Startseite. Die erste erstellte Seite erhält immer den Namen Wiki und ist die Hauptseite (als erstes angezeigte Seite). Der Name, die Festlegung der Hauptseite sowie die Inhalte lassen sich durch Umbenennen und Bearbeiten jederzeit anpassen. Eine weitere Wikiseite wird über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl aufgerufen. Im Dialog Neue Wiki-Seite müssen der Titel und die Übergeordnete Seite festgelegt werden. Anschließend öffnet sich das Bearbeitungsfenster mit der Wiki-Toolbar. Die Umbenennung der Seite, die Änderung der übergeordneten Seite oder die Zuordnung zu einem anderen Objekt erfolgt über den Prozess Seite umbenenen Die Sidebar dient der leichteren Navigation im Wiki. Sie enthält im Standard folgende Elemente: Hauptseite Seiten nach Titel sortiert Seiten nach Datum (der Erstellung) sortiert Mit der Auswahl Seiten nach Titel sortiert oder Seiten nach Datum sortiert werden die erstellten Wikiseiten aufgelistet. Im folgenden Beispiel ist die Sortierung nach Datum zu sehen Die Sidebar kann individuell ergänzt werden. Über den Button im oberen Bereich der Sidebar gelangt man in die Bearbeitungsseite der Sidebar. Die Wikiseite mit dem Namen Sidebar wird, sobald diese vorhanden ist, oberhalb der Standardelemente dargestellt. So lässt sich mit Hilfe von Seitenlinks ein Inhaltsverzeichnis aufbauen. Soll der Aufbau eines Inhaltsverzeichnisses automatisiert erfolgen, bietet sich das Wiki-Makro {{child_pages}} an. Dieses listet alle untergeordenten Seiten automatisch auf. Wird die Seite Sidebar der restlichen Seitenstruktur, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, übergeordnet so lässt sich mit dem folgenden Eintrag in der Seite Sidebar automatisiert die Seitenstruktur anzeigen. Soll das Inhaltsverzeichnis auf die ersten x Ebenen begrenzt werden, so kann dieses über den Zusatz {{child_pages(depth=_x_)}} eingeschränkt werden. Soll diese Untergliederung zur Sidebar nicht erfolgen oder ist die alphabetische Reihenfolge ungünstig, kann die Seite manuell strukturiert werden. Im Folgenden ist ein Beispiel einer manuell angelegten Seitenstruktur zu sehen # Wiki Sidebar (Beispiel) ## [[Testwiki]] {{child_pages(Testwiki)}} ## [[Neuer_Wiki_Baum|Baum 2]] {{child_pages(Neuer_Wiki_Baum)}} Die Sidebar sieht dann in dem Beispiel wie folgt aus: Über das 3-Punkte-Menü auf der Seite gelangt man zur Umbenennungsmaske der Wikiseite. Über diese Maske kann der Seitenname (in der URL) geändert werden, die Seite als Hauptseite (als erste angezeigte Seite) festgelegt werden, bei Namensänderung festlegt werden, dass existierende Links umgeleitet werden, das zugeordnete Objekt geändert werden und eine übergeordnete Seite festgelegt bzw. verändert werden. Mit der Namensänderung wird automatisch der URL-Name geändert. Damit funktionieren ggf. externe Links auf die Wikiseite nicht mehr. Wichtig ist dann, die Option Existierende Links umleiten ausgewählt zu haben. Eine Wiki-Seite kann über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl Löschen gelöscht werden. Nach der Auswahl wird nochmals abgefragt, ob die Seite wirklich gelöscht werden soll. Wird mit OK bestätigt ist die Wikiseite gelöscht. Über Klick auf den Button gelangt man in den Bearbeitungsmodus für die aktuelle Wikiseite. Die Bearbeitungsseite baut sich wie folgt (von oben nach unten) auf: Name der Wikiseite (rot) Wiki-Toolbar mit dem Bearbeitungsbereich Zuordung Übergeordente Seite Kommentar Dateieanhänge Diese Elemente werden im folgenden beschrieben. Der Name der Wikiseite lässt sich nicht im Bearbeitungsmodus ändern. Die Änderung ist über Seite umbenennen möglich. Die Textbearbeitung erfolgt in diesem Beispiel mit der Auszeichnungssprache Markdown. Grundsätzlich kann in der Administration auch Textile gewählt werden. In beiden Fällen bietet xmera Omnia eine Vorschau und die wichtigsten Formatierungselemente als Toolbar. Somit ist ein schneller Einstieg in die Bearbeitung möglich. Die Umschaltung zwischen dem Bearbeitungsmodus und der Vorschau erfolgt über den Tab . Die Bearbeitung erfolgt über die folgenden Button: Schrift in fett Schrift in kursiv Text unterstrichen Text durchgestrichen Darstellung des Texts als Quelltext ohne Formatierung Überschriften der Ebene 1 bis 3 Aufzählung Nummerierte Auflistung Aufgabenliste (nur CommonMark Editor) Darstellung eines Zitatbereichs Rücknahme eines Zitatbereichs Erstellen eines Tabellenrahmens Darstellung eines Textes in einem gesonderten Feld Abbildung von Code-Elementen mit farblicher Hervorhebung der Syntax Link zu einer anderen Wiki-Seite Einbindung einer Grafik. Einbindung eines Drawio Diagramms Einbindung eines Drawio Diagramms aus dem Dokumentenmanagementsystem Dokumente aus dem Dokumentenmanagementsystem einbinden Öffnen einer Hilfe für die verwendete Auszeichnungssprache (hier Markdown) Diese Funktionen lassen sich gut über die Vorschau ausprobieren. Das erleichtert die Einarbeitung in die Auszeichnungssprache. Am Ende der Tollbar können weitere Hilfen aufgerufen werden. So erhält der Nutzer weitere Tipps zur Formatierung der Texte und zum Einbinden von Informationen aus dem restlichen System. Einige wichtige Elemente sind für Markdown im Kapitel Syntax Markdown beschrieben. In dem Dropdown-Auswahlfeld kann eine bereits in dem Objekt erstellten Wikiseite als übergeordnete Seite ausgewählt werden. So wird eine Struktur dargestellt, die die Orientierung in den Menüs erleichtert. Das Wiki erstellt automatisch eine Historie der Änderungen. Um Änderungen besser nachvollziehbar zu machen, kann die Änderung mit einem Kommentar ergänzt werden. Hier können Dokumente an die Wikiseite angehängt werden, die dann auf der selben Seite zum Download bereitstehen oder in den Text eingearbeitet werden können. Die maximale Dateigröße wird durch die Administration begrenzt. Im Standard sind dieses 5 MB. Die so hinzugefügte Datei steht im unteren Bereich zur Ansicht bzw. zum Download bereit. Ein Dateianhang kann aber auch ohne den Weg über Seite bearbeiten über den Button an die Seite gehängt werden. An das Wiki angehängte Bilder lassen sich über das Wiki-Makro ![Bildbezeichung](Dateiname) leicht in die Wikiseite einbinden. Bilder, die in der Zwischenablage gespeichert wurden, wie bspw. Screenshots, können direkt per Strg+V in das Textfeld kopiert werden. Um bei Änderungen auf der Wikiseite informiert zu werden, kann der Button zugeschaltet werden. Er wechselt dann auf die Darstellung . Durch einen weiteren Klick auf den Button wird der Beobachtungsmodus wieder ausgeschaltet. Der Modus wirkt sich immer nur auf die eine Wikiseite aus. Alle Änderungen auf der Wikiseite werden in der Historie dokumentiert. Erreicht wird die Historie über das 3-Punkte-Menü und die Auswahl Historie. Es wird eine Liste der Wiki-Änderungen angezeigt. In der Liste werden das Datum der Änderung, der Autor und der Kommentar gelistet. Über die Auswahlpunkte zu Beginn jeder Zeile können zwei Änderungsschritte ausgewählt werden, die über den Button verglichen werden können. Rot hinterlegt sind gelöschte Passagen und grün hinterlegt sind hinzugefügte Passagen. Durch Klicken auf Annotieren in der Zeile der Veränderung wird die Wikiseite mit den einzelnen Änderungsschritten dargestellt. Jeder Änderungsschritt ist mit seiner Nummer und dem Autor mit einer eigenen Farbe dargestellt. Klickt man auf die Nummer des Änderungsschritts, wird die Wikiseite mit dem Bearbeitungsstand des gewählten Bearbeitungsschritts angezeigt. Über das dann erscheinende 3-Punkte-Menü kann auf diese Version zurückgesetzt werden. Wird Auf diese Version zurücksetzen gewählt, wird die Bearbeitung der Wikiseite mit dem ausgewählten Bearbeitungsstand geöffnet. Mit dem (ggf. Kommentieren) Speichern ist der Stand wiederhergestellt. Wiki-Makros sind vordefinierte Funktionen, die dynamische Inhalte in den Wikitext integrieren können. Eine aktuelle Übersicht über alle verfügbaren Makros erhält der Nutzer mit diesem Befehl: {{macro_list}} In der aktuellen Version von xmera Omnia sind das: Grafiken spielen im Rahmen des ISMS eine wichtige Rolle. Typische Grafiken sind der Netzplan, Prozesslandkarten oder Prozessablaufdiagramme. Hierfür eignet sich die Integration von Drawio besonders gut. Weitere Videos. Um Drawio in xmera Omnia nutzen zu können, muss dass System im Anwendungsbereich entsprechend konfiguriert sein. Bevor mit dem Zeichnen begonnen werden kann, wird eine Standarddatei mit Hilfe der Wiki-Toolbar erstellt. Hierzu muss gelickt werden. Es erscheint folgendes Eingabefenster: Nach Eingabe eines Dateinamen und ggf. Auswahl weiterer Parameter, muss auf Makro einfügen geklickt werden. Das Makro {{drawio_attach(dateiname.png)}} wird angezeigt. Nach dem Speichern erscheint ein Startbutton: Nach dem Doppelklick auf den Startbutton kann mit der Zeichnung begonnen werden. Markdown ist eine Auszeichnungssprache die auch aus dem git-Umdeld bekannt ist. Sie ermöglicht es einen Fließtext durch einfache Ergänzungen in eine formatierte Form zu bringen. Die wichtigsten Hilfen sind über den Button in der Wiki-Toolbar zu erhalten. Es öffnet sich ein Fenster mit den wichtigsten Formatierungs- und Verlinkungsmöglichkeiten. Am Ende ist ein Link mit mehr Informationen. Dieser Link öffnet wiederum eine neue Seite mit detaillierteren Beschreibungen. Wenn weitere Hilfe benötigt wird, hilft die Suche im Internet mit dem Suchbegriff Markdown Redmine.","title":"Wiki","component":"xmera-omnia-guide","version":"latest","name":"wiki","url":"/xmera-omnia-guide/latest/anwenderhandbuch/wiki.html","titles":[{"text":"Funktionen Wiki","hash":"_funktionen_wiki","id":1},{"text":"Wiki erstellen","hash":"_wiki_erstellen","id":2},{"text":"Die erste Seite","hash":"_die_erste_seite","id":3},{"text":"Neue Seite","hash":"_neue_seite","id":4},{"text":"Sidebar nutzen und bearbeiten","hash":"_sidebar_nutzen_und_bearbeiten","id":5},{"text":"Seite umbenennen","hash":"_seite_umbenennen","id":6},{"text":"Seite löschen","hash":"_seite_löschen","id":7},{"text":"Wikiseite bearbeiten","hash":"_wikiseite_bearbeiten","id":8},{"text":"Name der Wikiseite","hash":"_name_der_wikiseite","id":9},{"text":"Wiki-Toolbar","hash":"_wiki_toolbar","id":10},{"text":"Zuordnung Übergeordnete Seite","hash":"_zuordnung_übergeordnete_seite","id":11},{"text":"Kommentar","hash":"_kommentar","id":12},{"text":"Dateianhänge","hash":"_dateianhänge","id":13},{"text":"Seite beobachten","hash":"_seite_beobachten","id":14},{"text":"Änderungshistorie","hash":"_änderungshistorie","id":15},{"text":"Wiki-Makros einsetzen","hash":"_wiki_makros_einsetzen","id":16},{"text":"Grafiken erstellen","hash":"_grafiken_erstellen","id":17},{"text":"Syntax Markdown","hash":"_syntax_markdown","id":18}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"Um an einem Beispiel die Vorteile von xmera Omnia zeigen zu können, wurde die demo GmbH erfunden.

Dieser Guide führt Sie daher in kurzen Videosequenzen durch die mit Daten befüllten Bereiche, um diese gezielt in Ihrer Testinstanz aufsuchen zu können. Gleichzeitig lässt Ihnen die Demo genug Raum eigene Daten testweise einzupflegen. Das Rollen- und Rechtemanagement ist eine wichtige Funktionalität eines ISMS-Tools. So sind in der Demo folgende Rollen als Beispiel hinterlegt: Objektverantwortlicher Überwachungsverantwortlicher Aufgabenverantwortlicher Risikoverantwortlicher Beobachter Meldungsberechtigter Disponent Diese Rollen können innerhalb eines Objektes dem Benutzer oder einer Benutzergruppe zugewiesen werden. Damit erhält ein Benutzer Rechte in einem oder mehreren Objekten. Objekte und Elemente, an denen ein Benutzer keine Rechte besitzt, werden ihm nicht angezeigt und sind somit auch nicht zugänglich. Der Benutzer demo-tester ist in allen Objekten Objektverantwortlicher. Damit sieht er alles und kann auch Konfigurationen in den Objekten anpassen. Eine eingeschränkte Sicht auf Daten, die ein Nutzer mit einer anderen Rolle hätte, ist mit dem Testnutzer nicht möglich. Auf Anfrage können für die xmera Omnia Demo auch (fiktive) Benutzer mit anderen Rollen freigeschaltet werden. Die Rolle des Administrators gehört jedoch nicht dazu. Kein ISMS gleicht dem Anderen. Viele Randbedingungen beeinflussen die Gestaltung der ISMS Prozesse einer Organisation. xmera Omnia hat die Prämisse sich an die Organisation anzupassen und ist damit an sehr vielen Stellen individuell konfigurierbar. Diese Flexibilität von xmera Omnia lässt sich jedoch in einer Demo nicht abbilden, ohne den Nutzer zu irritieren. Wir haben daher in der Demo eine Konfiguration gewählt, die zeigt, wie wir uns die ISMS-Prozesse für diese spezielle demo GmbH vorstellen. Das ist aber nur ein Weg das ISMS mit xmera Omnia umzusetzen. Wenn Sie Fragen zu speziellen Prozessabläufen haben, sprechen Sie uns gerne an. xmera Solutions bietet ihren Kunden auch Workshops an, in denen mit Ihnen eine individuelle xmera Omnia Konfiguration für Ihr Unternehmen und Ihre Organisation erarbeitet wird. Die Demo ist dafür gemacht, dass xmera Omnia durch Interessenten ausprobiert werden kann. Das kann dazu führen, dass etwas durcheinander kommt. Falls so etwas passiert, keine Panik.

Auf der Hauptseite der Demo wird eines der Dashboards angezeigt. Es gibt stets ein System-Dashboard, das für alle Nutzer die selben Inhalte darstellt, aber vom Administrator frei gestaltet werden kann. Neben dem System-Dashboard können beliebig viele weitere Dashboards angelegt werden. Nachfolgend sehen Sie das Dashboard der ISO 27k Demo. Die in der jeweiligen Demo angelegten Dashboards können Sie über diese Schaltfläche auswählen: Topmenü Das Topmenü (oben links) ist auf allen Seiten eingeblendet und ermöglicht es, mit einem Klick auf die Basisseiten zu springen. Die Topmenüpunkte sind: Haupseite, Meine Seite, Objekte und DMS. Benutzermenü Das Benutzermenü ist in der oberen Menüleiste rechts platziert. Es zeigt von links nach rechts den Namen des angemeldeten Benutzer, die Anzahl der ungelesenen Meldungen, die für den Benutzer vorliegen, einen Zugang zu den persönlichen Einstellungen (Mein Konto), ein Button zum Abmelden des Benutzers. Suche Der Suchbereich zeigt unterhalb vom Benutzermenü ein Suchfenster und daneben einen Schnellzugang an. In dem Suchfenster kann ein beliebiger Suchbegriff eingegeben werden. Nach der Bestätigung wird eine Liste der Suchergebnisse angezeigt. Die Suche kann in diesem Fenster auf definierte Objekte eingegrenzt werden. Klickt man in das Feld Schnellzugriff (Zu einem Objekt springen), wird eine Liste der zuletzt verwendeten Objekte und aller übrigen Objekte angezeigt. Durch einen Klick auf das gewünschte Objekt springt man gleich in das Übersichtsfenster des ausgewählten Objekts. Auf Meine Seite kann sich der Benutzer ein Dashboard mit den für ihn wichtigen Informationen zusammenstellen. Über das Feld Hinzufügen kann man verschiedene Blöcke in die Seite integrieren. Diese Blöcke lassen sich wiederum bearbeiten. Bei einem Mouseover wird im oberen rechten Bereich des Blocks eine Bearbeitungsleiste eingeblendet. Bei Klick auf das Zahnrad (steht nicht bei allen Blöcken zur Auswahl) können Einstellungen am Block vorgenommen werden. Der gekreuzte Pfeil kennzeichnet die Drag & Drop Funktion. Bei gehaltener linker Maustaste kann der Block verschoben werden (siehe Bild unten) und bei Klick auf das Kreuz wird der Block entfernt. Auf diese Weise kann sich der Benutzer seine Seite gestalten. Unter dem Menüpunkt Objekte befindet sich der Bereich, in dem die Datenbearbeitung erfolgt. In der Demo wird folgendes Fenster angezeigt. In der Objektübersicht sind die Wurzelobjekte zu sehen. In der Demo werden folgende Wurzelelemente genutzt: A Management: Abbildung der Prozesse des ISMS-Managementprozess B Prozesse & Informationen: Erfassung und Bewertung der Organisationsprozesse und der Informationen, die für Informationsprozesse benötigt werden C Services: Darstellung zu internen und externen Dienstleistern D IT-Betrieb: Abbildung der IT-Anwendungen, IT-Systeme, Netzwerke E Infrastruktur: Abbildung von Standorten, Gebäuden, Räumen F Audit: Abbildung der internen und externen Audits G Changeprozesse: Abbildung von Projekten im Bereich der Informationsverarbeitung (es könnten aber auch beliebige Projekte sein) H Meldungen: Erfassen und Verarbeiten von Service-Tickets, Störungen und Vorfällen I Vorgaben & Regeln Zentraler Ort für übergreifende Reglungen und Vorgaben der Organisation Diese Struktur ist demo-spezifisch und sollte an die Erfordernisse der Organisation angepasst werden. Sie ist hier so gewählt, dass sich die einzelnen funktionalen Zusammenhänge eines ISMS mit xmera Omnia gut nachvollziehen lassen. Von der Objektübersicht kann man durch Klicken auf die Karten in die einzelnen Objekte wechseln. Objektmenü Die Objektseiten besitzen im Vergleich zu den anderen Seiten ein zusätzliches Objektmenü. Im Objektmenü, das sich zwischen Hauptmenü und dem Objektnamen (im Basisbild der Demo Objekte) befindet, werden die in diesem Objekt zur Verfügung stehenden Module als Menüelemente dargestellt. Das gerade angezeigte Menüelement ist unterstrichen. Das Menü der Objektübersichtsseite zeigt, wie im folgenden Bild zu sehen, die Module an, die objektübergreifende Informationen bereitstellen. Hier kann über den Menüpunkt Objekte immer wieder zur Objektübersicht gesprungen werden. Ist man in einem spezifischen Objekt, so werden auch hier nur die Module angezeigt, die in dem Objekt aktiviert wurden. Eine weitere Besonderheit ist, dass zu Beginn des Menüs ein + dargestellt ist, das dem Schnellzugriff dient. Beim Klicken auf das Kreuz erscheint eine Liste von Elementen, bei denen man direkt in die zugehörige Erfassungsmaske springen kann. Abfragen Objektseiten, in denen Listen von Objekten oder Aufgaben gelistet werden, haben einen identischen Aufbau. Über der Liste werden die Einstellungen für Filter und (Anzeige-) Optionen dargestellt. In der Systemeinstellung ist der Filter auf- und die Optionen zugeklappt. Durch Klicken auf den Pfeil neben dem Text können die Elemente auf- oder zugeklappt werden. Der Filter bietet die Möglichkeit nach zahlreichen Attribut-Inhalten zu filtern. Es können Filterelemente hinzugefügt und wieder deaktiviert werden. Im Bereich der Optionen kann die Darstellung der Liste angepasst werden.

Hierzu sind für die Einführung eines ISMS - der Projektauftrag, - die Rollen, - die Ziele, - die Projektplanung und - die Kommunikationsstruktur festzulegen. Dabei ist für ein ISMS nach CISIS 12 die Anwendbarkeitserklärung (SOA) von zentraler Bedeutung. Sie definiert die Grenzen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems. In CISIS 12 helfen bei der Definition der SOA die Bausteingruppen. Nicht relevante Bausteingruppen können mit nachvollziehbarer Begründung ausgeschlossen werden. Der 1. Schritt ist die Erstellung einer Leitlinie, in die grundlegende Festlegungen wie z.B. die Verantwortlichkeiten oder der Geltungsbereich für das ISMS definiert sind. In Schritt 2 geht es um die Sensibilisierung der Beschäftigten. Es sind Maßnahmen zu planen, die das Bewusstsein (Awareness) der MitarbeiterInnen für das Thema Informationssicherheit erhöhen. In Schritt 3 ist das ISMS-Team zu benennen, das den Aufbau, die Aufrechterhaltung und die Verbesserung der ISMS Prozesse verantwortet. Das Einführungsprojekt ist mit Hilfe der Projektmanagement-Funktionen im Bereich Management » ISMS » Implementierung ISMS abgebildet. Jeder CISIS 12 Schritt ist geplant, beschrieben und terminiert. Den einzelnen Schritten können weitere Aufgaben zugeordnet werden. Die Funktionen Aufgabenmanagement Dokumentenmanagement Verlauf Paket und Stapel unterstützen bei der Durchführung und Überwachung des Projekts. xmera Omnia integriert die CISIS 12 Bausteine. Jeder Baustein ist mit seinem Ziel und den dazugehörigen Maßnahmen abgebildet. Der Aufbau eines einzelnen Bausteins erlaubt diverse Filtermöglichkeiten wie bspw. nach den Modalverben Muss, Soll, Kann. Mit den Bausteinen hat jeder Maßnahmenverantwortliche alle relevanten Informationen des CISIS 12-Kataloges direkt im Zugriff und kann so die Maßnahmen zielgerichtet umsetzen. Weiter wird durch Gliederung nach Bausteinen (z.B. in der Anwendbarkeitserklärung) und Filterung oder Sortierung nach der Relevanz die Übersichtlichkeit erheblich verbessert. Der Anforderungskatalog kann an zentraler Stelle importiert und verwaltet werden. Von hier aus können Maßnahmen manuell oder automatisiert auf Assets der Organisation verteilt werden. Durch die Verknüpfung der zentralen Maßnahmenliste mit den operativ dezentral durchzuführenden Maßnahmen, kann der Reifegrad zentral überwacht werden. Die Begründung zur Relevanz von Sicherheitsanforderungen kann direkt in der Sicherheitsanforderung abgebildet werden. Die Anwendbarkeitserklärung kann zur weiteren Verarbeitung oder Vorlage beim Auditor exportiert werden. xmera Omnia bietet mit dem Modul DMS ein Dokumentenmanagementsystem, mit dem die Zugänglichkeit und Änderbarkeit von Dokumenten gesteuert, Dokumente strukturiert und klassifiziert, Änderungen versioniert und Freigaben über einen Genehmigungsworkflow organisiert und dokumentiert werden können. Das DMS Modul ist in jedem Objekt verfügbar und kann bei Bedarf aktiviert werden. Zugriffssteuerung Dokumente, die für alle Mitarbeiter relevant sind, können in einem eigens dafür vorgesehenen Objekt zentral verwaltet und zugänglich gemacht werden. Der Zugriff auf Dokumente, die dagegen nur für bestimmte Interessensgruppen relevant sind, kann durch eine entsprechende Rechtevergabe gesteuert werden. Das ist sowohl zentral als auch dezentral in Objekten, die als Arbeitsbereiche, Assets oder Projekte genutzt werden, möglich. Durch zuordnen der Dokumente zu Ordnern sowie durch (administrativ erstellbare) Attribute lassen sich die Dokumente leicht strukturieren. Mit Hilfe von Verknüpfungen einzelner Dokumente zu anderen Elementen in xmera Omnia können Dokumente übergreifend den berechtigten Nutzern zugänglich gemacht werden. Versionierung Zentraler Bestandteil des DMS ist die Versionierung. Dokumente, die mit ihren Metadaten erfasst wurden, können nicht direkt verändert werden. Änderungen müssen in einer neuen Version erfolgen. Damit ist eine Änderungsverfolgung jeder Änderung des Dokuments einschließlich seiner Metadaten möglich. Zusätzlich können Dokumente auch vor ungewollten Änderungen geschützt werden. Genehmigungsworkflow Das DMS in xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit, die Freigabe von Dokumenten über einen Genehmigungsworkflow durchzuführen und zu dokumentieren. Ein Genehmigungsworkflow beschreibt den Ablauf des Freigabeprozesses. In xmera Omnia können verschiedene Freigabeprozesse (z.B. für Richtlinien, Handlungsanweisungen oder Betriebshandbücher) abgebildet werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Auch bei Aufgabenpaketen werden unterlagerte Maßnahmen und Aufgaben kumuliert dargestellt, so dass auch hier leicht ein Umsetzungsgrad überwacht werden kann. Verknüpfung zwischen Maßnahmen und Aufgaben Maßnahmen können auf verschiedenste Weise verknüpft werden. Der Bearbeitungstatus und der Umsetzungsgrad von untergeordneten Aufgaben ist in den übergeordneten Elementen zu sehen und kann den Status und den Umsetzungsgrad des übergeordneten Elements beeinflussen. Tabellarische und graphische Auswertung Zur Priorisierung und Umsetzungsüberwachung bietet xmera Omnia mehrere Möglichkeiten der Datenauswertung. Dabei unterstützen Filterfunktionen und eine flexible Spaltenanordnung innerhalb der Tabellen. Zusätzliche graphische Auswertungen runden die Analyse ab. xmera Omnia bietet mit im Rahmen des Aufgabenmanagements die Möglichkeit aus den Maßnahmen der Sicherheitsanforderungen, der Risikobewertung, der Vorfallanalyse oder den Audits betrieblich umzusetzende Aufgaben zu erstellen und zu überwachen. Planen Aufgaben können bspw. als Abfolge (Vorgänger, Nachfolger) oder unabhängig geplant werden. Sie können zu Arbeitspaketen zusammengefasst werden, um so die Umsetzung einzelner Meilensteine besser beobachten und steuern zu können. Zu jeder Art von Aufgabe lassen sich Unteraufgaben, Kopien oder Verknüpfungen zu bestehenden Aufgaben erstellen. Somit lassen sich Beziehungen zwischen Aufgaben abbilden. Wiederholende Aufgaben planen Sie mit dem gleichnamigen Modul, das in jedem Objekt aktiviert werden kann. Delegieren Aufgaben können Mitarbeitern oder auch Gruppen zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann sich im Dashboard \"seine Aufgaben\" anzeigen lassen und erhält damit eine Übersicht auf seine offenen Arbeiten. Im Benutzerprofil hat jeder Mitarbeiter die Möglichkeit eine Option für die automatische E-Mailbenachrichtigung zu wählen, um über Änderungen im System benachrichtigt zu werden. Überwachen In jeder Aufgabe kann der Status und der Umsetzungsgrad dargestellt werden. Diese Werte werden auch an die untergeordneten Aufgaben übertragen. Ein Status einer (Eltern-)Aufgabe kann wiederum vom Status der unterlagerten Aufgaben abhängig gemacht werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Das beinhaltet die Wartungprozesse, die Störungsprozesse und die Änderungsprozesse. Das Management ist an die Größe der Organisation anzupassen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist auch das Lieferantenmanagement, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit dem Outsourcing von ID-Diensten, zu betrachten. xmera Omnia unterstützt das IT-Servicemanagement in vielfältiger Weise. Die Wartungs- und Störungsprozesse können durch das Aufgaben/Ticket-Management gesteuert werden. Bei komplexeren Change-/Änderungsprozessen bietet sich das in xmera Omnia integrierte Projektmanagement an. xmera Omnia unterstützt den gesamten Prozess des Vorfallmanagements. Dazu gehört die automatisierte Zuordnung von eingehenden Meldungen zu einzelnen Mitarbeitern oder Gruppen, die Priorisierung und Gruppierung sowie die Analyse des Vorfalls. Automatisieren In der xmera Omnia Demo ist die Meldungserfassung abgebildet. Meldungen können, genau wie Aufgaben, automatisch einem Bearbeiter oder einer Bearbeitergruppe zugewiesen werden. Die Erstellung einer Meldung kann im System selbst erfolgen oder per E-Mail an das System gesendet werden. Der E-Mail-Empfang ist in der Testinstanz nicht verfügbar. Besteht bereits eine Lösung für das Vorfallmangement (z.B. Ticketsystem) kann über die E-Mail- oder API-Schnittstelle von xmera Omnia eine Kopplung der Systeme erreicht werden. Priorisieren und Gruppieren Die einlaufende Meldung kann je nach Beurteilung anschließend als Aufgabe, Störung oder Vorfall eingestuft werden. Dieser können dann noch sich ergebende Unteraufgaben zugeordnet werden. Der Vorfall läßt sich über die Priorisierung und Kategorisierung weiter strukturieren. Durch Verknüpfungen zu anderen Vorfällen lassen sich auch ähnliche Vorfälle zusammenfassen. Über die Funktion Eigene Felder lassen sich leicht weitere Felder in eine Aufgabe integrieren und so an den Nutzer anpassen. Analysieren Zur Analyse ist in xmera Omnia die 5-W-Methode (5-Why-Methode nach Toyoda Sakichi) implementiert. Dabei wird in 5 Frageschritten der Vorfall aus verschiedenen Aspekten beleuchtet. Ziel ist es, Maßnahmen zu finden, die präventiv einen solchen Vorfall verhindern oder die Auswirkungen verringern. Diese Maßnahmen können wiederum als Unteraufgabe dem Vorfall zugeordnet werden. Da xmera Omnia auf einem klassischen Projektmanagementsystem basiert, ist das Ticketsystem integraler Bestandteil. So basieren die Maßnahmen, Risikobeurteilungen oder Aufgaben im engeren Sinne auf diesem Ticketsystem. In der Administration können weitere Aufgabentypen, Bezeichnungen für (Ticket-)Formulare, angelegt und über eigene Felder erweitert werden. Auf diese Weise können auch weitere Prozesse, wie z.B. das Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia integriert werden. Falls Sie die Umsetzung des Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia interessiert, sprechen Sie uns an. xmera Omnia basiert im Kern auf einem Projektmanagementsystem. Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat. Über Meldungen lassen sich Informationen im Projektteam verteilen. Über Foren lassen sich Diskussionsrunden abbilden. Über das Wiki kann Projektwissen dokumentiert und weitergeben werden.

Objekte werden mit Hilfe von Objektklassen, die wie eine Vorlage funktionieren, in eine für die Organisation geeignete Objekthierarchie eingegliedert. Dabei kann die Struktur nach beliebigen Kriterien aufgebaut werden. Zu den wichtigsten Objekten gehören das ISMS-Projekt, in dem sich der Informationssicherheitsbeauftragte organisiert und das ISMS steuert, die Prozesse und Informationen, die der Ausgangspunkt für alle folgenden Maßnahmen sind und es ermöglichen Prozesse zu beschreiben sowie ihren Schutzbedarf zu bestimmen, die IT-Asset Objekte, die mit der hinterlegten Dokumentation die Systemsteckbriefe darstellen und alles für den Systembetrieb abbilden können. Mit Hilfe des übergreifenden Aufgabenmanagements werden alle notwendigen IT-Maßnahmen gesteuert und überwacht. Dabei stehen in jedem Objekt verschiedene Dokumentationsmodule zur Verfügung, die den Nutzer bei der Dokumentation unterstützen. Dazu gehören das Dokumentenmanagementmodul (DMS) (beschrieben in Kapitel CISIS 12 Start), die Module Dokumente und Dateien und das Wiki. Diese werden im Folgenden beschrieben: Wenn für die Pflege von Dokumenten, die einem Objekt zugeordnet werden, keine Funktionen wie die Versionierung, der Freigabeworkflow oder komplexere Ordnerstrukturen benötigt werden, bieten sich die xmera Omnia Module Datei und Dokumente an. Dateien Das Modul Dateien ermöglicht es, einem Objekt Dateien zuzuordnen. Die Liste beinhaltet den Dateinamen, das Datum der Zuordnung, die Anzahl der Downloads (D/L), sowie die sha256 Prüfsumme. Über eine Tooltip wird eine Dateibeschreibung, die beim Upload erfasst wird, dargestellt. Inhalte einfacher Textdateien können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. Dokumente Das Modul Dokumente bietet die Möglichkeit, einem Objekt eine oder mehrere Dokumentensammlungen zuzuordnen. Eine Dokumentensammlung wird charakterisiert durch eine Dokumentenkategorie (Kategorien können über die Administration angepasst werden), eine Dokumentenbeschreibung und eine oder mehrere zugeordnete Dateien (mit einer Dateibeschreibung). Die Dokumentensammlungen lassen sich nach der Dokumentenkategorie, dem Zuordnungsdatum, dem Dokumententitel oder dem Autor (Benutzer der das Dokument angelegt hat) gruppieren. Dokumente können heruntergeladen werden. Inhalte einfacher Textdokumente können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. In jedem Objekt in xmera Omnia kann das Modul Wiki aktiviert werden. Dieses bietet alle typischen Funktionalitäten eines Wiki. Es ermöglicht Informationen und Wissen kollaborativ zu bearbeiten und zu benutzen. Es eignet sich im Umfeld des ISMS, um Handbücher bereitzustellen oder auch Prozess- / Handlungsbeschreibungen zu einem Asset zu dokumentieren. Diagramme und Flowcharts xmera Omnia integriert Drawio (https://www.diagrams.net/) für das Erstellen von Diagrammen und Flowcharts, die in das Wiki integriert werden können.

Dabei können die Geschäftsprozesse und die zugehörigen Informationen abgebildet werden, um auf dieser Basis die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung durchzuführen. Geschäftsprozesse werden in xmera Omnia als Objekte dargestellt. Hierfür ist die Objektklasse Prozess vordefiniert und kann nach Bedarf angepasst werden. Über den hierarchischen Aufbau der Objekte können relevante Prozesse der Ablauforganisation abgebildet werden. Optional können dann die für den Betrieb des Prozesses notwendigen Informationsobjekte zugeordnet werden. Informationen sind die primären Assets einer Organisation. Sie dienen als Bindeglied zwischen Prozess und Anwendung. Der Prozess beschreibt eine Handlung. Eine Information kann sowohl zur Durchführung dieser Handlung notwendig, als auch ihr Erzeugnis sein. Bei der Erfassung von Informationen kann auf Informationsklassen zurückgegriffen werden, die eine Grundkonfiguration im Bereich der Schutzbedarfsfestlegung aber auch des Datenschutzes ermöglichen. Der Schutzbedarf der Information wird durch die Prozesseigner definiert. Dieser wird über die logischen Verknüpfungen zu den für die Informationsverarbeitung notwendigen sekundären Assets vererbt. Die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung in xmera Omnia ermöglicht die Beurteilung des Schutzbedarfs anhand eines Fragenkatalogs. Dieser Fragenkatalog kann individuell angepasst werden. Somit lässt sich zum Beispiel direkt durch die Prozesseigner der Schutzbedarf für die von ihnen benötigten Informationen ermitteln. Aufwendige Interviews entfallen.

Von daher wollen wir diese nicht unerwähnt lassen. Im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS) gibt es in vielen Bereichen wiederkehrende Aufgaben. Typische Aktivitäten zum Aufbau und Betrieb eines ISMS sind beispielsweise: Monatliche Besprechung und Abstimmung im ISMS-Team Jährliche Überprüfung, Aktualisierung und Fortschreibung der Informationssicherheitsleitlinie Vierteljährliche Überprüfung der Zutrittsrechte Jährliche [Auditplanung] uvm. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie beliebig viele Aufgaben mit individuellen Wiederholungszyklen planen. Zudem können Sie jede wiederkehrende Aufgabe einer Person zuordnen, einen Fertigstellungstermin und die Bearbeitungsdauer planen. Da die Funktion der Wiederholende Aufgaben als Objektmodul konzipiert ist, können Sie sie in jedem beliebigen Objekt aktivieren. Dadurch lassen sich Wiederholende Aufgaben auch gut im [IT-Servicemanagement] einsetzen. xmera Omnia bietet verschiedene Schnittstellen an, die den Austausch mit externen Systemen oder Personen ermöglichen. PDF-Export Der PDF-Export bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgabenlisten, den Verlauf oder Wiki-Seiten als PDF-Datei herunterzuladen. Wiki-Seiten können auch als HTML-Datei oder Text-Datei heruntergeladen werden. CSV-Schnittstelle Die CSV-Schnittstelle ermöglicht einen manuellen Austausch von Listen. Exportiert werden können die Abfragelisten der Objekte und Aufgaben. Dabei ist eine individuelle Anpassung der zu übertragenden Attribute möglich. Die CSV-Importschnittstelle ermöglicht es Aufgaben zu importieren. Das können Maßnahmenkataloge aus eigenen Vorgaben oder anderen Standards oder auch Aufgaben aus einem anderen Ticket-Systemen sein, die in das System integriert werden sollen. API / E-Mail Schnittstelle Dynamischer sind dabei die Online-Schnittstellen wie die E-Mail-Kopplung oder die API, über die dynamisch externe Systeme integriert werden können. Die E-Mail-Schnittstelle ermöglicht es, eingehende E-Mails in eine Aufgabe zu wandeln. Bei der Einhaltung der Format-Regeln, können die E-Mails konkreten Objekten und definierten Aufgabentypen zugeordnet werden. Die API-Schnittstelle in xmera Omnia ermöglicht einen Datenaustausch bei Objekten, Aufgaben und Benutzern. Dabei wird das Anlegen, Ändern, Löschen oder auch Archivieren unterstützt. Die API-Schnittstelle unterstützt dabei sowohl das xml- als auch json-Format. Berechtigungen werden in xmera Omnia auf Ebene der Objekte verwaltet. Zugriff auf ein Objekt erhalten nur jene Benutzer, die dem Objekt zugeordnet wurden. Die Zuordnung wird in der Objektkonfiguration vorgenommen. Dabei wird für einem Benutzer oder eine Gruppe eine passende Rolle gewählt. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, ein Objekt öffentlich zu machen. Damit kann jeder angemeldete Benutzer im System automatisch auf dieses Objekt zugreifen. Die Benutzer, Gruppen und Rollen werden in der Administration gepflegt. Es besteht die Möglichkeit der LDAP-Kopplung. Somit kann zentral festgelegt werden, welche Benutzer Zutritt zum System haben sollen. Der Objektverantwortliche legt dann fest, welche Benutzer mit welchen Rechten als Mitglied auf ein Objekt zugreifen können. Zur Vereinfachung der Mitgliederverwaltung können die Mitglieder vom übergeordneten Objekt geerbt werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Hier wird insbesondere die Verfügbarkeit und Verwendbarkeit für die Nutzer, die Steuerung des Zugriffs, der Schutz vor nicht autorisierten Änderungen, die Nachverfolgbarkeit von Änderungen aber auch die Abbildung notwendiger Dokumente aus externen Quellen gefordert. xmera Omnia bietet mit dem Modul DMS ein Dokumentenmanagementsystem, mit dem die Zugänglichkeit und Änderbarkeit von Dokumenten gesteuert, Dokumente strukturiert und klassifiziert, Änderungen versioniert und Freigaben über einen Genehmigungsworkflow organisiert und dokumentiert werden können. Das DMS Modul ist in jedem Objekt verfügbar und kann bei Bedarf aktiviert werden. Zugriffssteuerung Dokumente, die für alle Mitarbeiter relevant sind, können in einem eigens dafür vorgesehenen Objekt zentral verwaltet und zugänglich gemacht werden. Der Zugriff auf Dokumente, die dagegen nur für bestimmte Interessensgruppen relevant sind, kann durch eine entsprechende Rechtevergabe gesteuert werden. Das ist sowohl zentral als auch dezentral in Objekten, die als Arbeitsbereiche, Assets oder Projekte genutzt werden, möglich. Durch zuordnen der Dokumente zu Ordnern sowie durch (administrativ erstellbare) Attribute lassen sich die Dokumente leicht strukturieren. Mit Hilfe von Verknüpfungen einzelner Dokumente zu anderen Elementen in xmera Omnia können Dokumente übergreifend den berechtigten Nutzern zugänglich gemacht werden. Versionierung Zentraler Bestandteil des DMS ist die Versionierung. Dokumente, die mit ihren Metadaten erfasst wurden, können nicht direkt verändert werden. Änderungen müssen in einer neuen Version erfolgen. Damit ist eine Änderungsverfolgung jeder Änderung des Dokuments einschließlich seiner Metadaten möglich. Zusätzlich können Dokumente auch vor ungewollten Änderungen geschützt werden.

Basierend auf dieser Richtlinie sind dann die Risikoermittlung, Risikobehandlung (Risikobehandlungsplan) und die Überwachung durchzuführen. Basis für die Risikobeurteilungen in xmera Omnia sind Gefährdungen. Gefährdungen beschreiben verschiedene Bedrohungsarten und verknüpfen sie mit einer potentiellen Schwachstelle. xmera Omnia bietet ein Importpaket des Gefährdungskataloges gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27005 oder IT-Grundschutz an, das um individuelle Gefährdungen erweitert werden kann. Jede Gefährdung kann verschiedenen Objektklassen zugeordnet werden. Über den Synchronisationsprozess werden die Gefährdungen dann einem Asset oder einer Assetgruppe zugeordnet. Die Risikobewertung erfolgt auf Basis von zugeordneten Gefährdungen. Durch Festlegung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadensklasse wird über die Risikoakzeptanzmatrix ein resultierendes Risiko ermittelt. Risikoakzeptanzmatrix Für die Ermittlung des Risikoniveaus wird in xmera Omnia eine individuell konfigurierbare Risikoakzeptanzmatrix bereitgestellt, in der für jede Kombination aus Eintrittshäufigkeit und Schadensklasse ein Risikoniveau zugeordnet werden kann. In der Demo wird hierfür eine 4 x 4 Matrix verwendet, woraus sich 16 Kombinationen ergeben. Da die Konfiguration der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix im Administrationsbereich vorgenommen werden muss, ist eine Anpassung im Rahmen der Demo nicht möglich. Risikobehandlung Die gewählte Risikobehandlungsoption und das sich daraus ergebende neue Risikoniveau lassen sich ebenfalls in der Risikobeurteilung abbilden. Wird eine Maßnahme erforderlich, kann diese direkt erstellt und mit der Risikobeurteilung verknüpft werden. Wird ein Risikoniveau durch eine Maßnahme reduziert oder vermieden, so kann die Maßnahmen als Unteraufgabe an die Gefährdung gekoppelt werden. Alle Maßnahmen, die aus einer Risikobeurteilung erwachsen sind, können dann in einem Risikobehandlungsplan zusammengefasst werden.

Diese Struktur soll die Verantwortlichkeiten (Asset-Owner) abbilden, die Basis für das Betriebshandbuch sein und einen fachkundigen Dritten eine Aufrechterhaltung des IT-Betriebs ermöglichen. Weiter muss der Schutzbedarf aus der in Schritt 6 durchgeführten Schutzbedarfsfeststellung für kritische Prozesse und Informationen auf die IT-Assets vererbt werden. Als dritte Aufgabe sind die Maßnahmen gemäß CISIS 12 Katalog den Assets zuzuordnen. Assets werden in xmera Omnia als Objekte erfasst. Diese Objekte können hierarchisch strukturiert werden. So können über den Hierarchiebaum beispielsweise die Aufbauorganisation und damit Verantwortlichkeiten der Organisation abgebildet werden. Alternativ könnten Assets mit gleichem Schutzbedarf analog zu räumlichen Sicherheitszonen im Hierarchiebaum zusammengefasst werden. Den Assets können Mitarbeiter zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann in der für ein spezifisches Asset passenden Rolle hinzugefügt werden. Dabei stehen die Rollen zur Verfügung, die über das Berechtigungsmanagement vom Administrator angelegt wurden. In der Demo sind das beispielsweise der Objektverantwortliche, Aufgabenverantwortliche, Risikoverantwortliche oder Beobachter. Neben den hierarchischen Strukturen können auch logische Verknüpfungen (Zusammenhänge zwischen den Objekten) abgebildet werden. Objektverknüpfungen bilden die Basis für die Vererbung des Schutzbedarfs, der in der Schutzbedarfsanalyse auf Ebene der Informationsobjekte oder Geschäftsprozesse ermittelt wird. Beispiel einer Vererbungskette Informationen → werden in einer Anwendung gepflegt → die auf einem Server läuft → der in einem Serverraum → in einem Werksgebäude steht. Über die logischen Strukturen lassen sich so Abhängigkeitsketten von der Information zu all den für die Informationsverarbeitung notwendigen Assets (Objekten) abbilden. Der Schutzbedarf der sekundären Assets, wie z.B. Anwendungen, Desktop-PC’s, Server oder auch Serverräume und Gebäude, ist abhängig von den in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Über die Struktur der logischen Verknüpfungen im Assetregister lassen sich die Schutzbedarfe der primären Assets (Prozesse und Informationen) auf die sekundären Assets übertragen. Somit haben die Verantwortlichen dieser Assets jederzeit einen Überblick über den Schutzbedarf, der in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Der Schutzbedarf des Assets wird mit dem Maximalprinzip ermittelt und kann im Rahmen der Schutzbedarfsfeststellung der Assets übernommen werden. Wenn wegen dem Kumulations- oder Verteilungseffekt vom sonst üblichen Maximumprinzip vom automatisch übertragenen Schutzbedarf abgewichen werden muss, dann ist das in xmera Omnia an jeder Stelle in der Vererbungskette möglich. Ausfüllhilfen für Mitarbeiter Definitionen von Fachbegriffen wie dem Kumulations- und Verteilungseffekt finden Sie in der Demo beispielhaft unter Objekte → I Vorgaben & Regeln → Wiki → ISMS-Handbuch → 2. Schutzbedarffeststellung. Diese haben wir als Ausfüllhilfe über der Schutzbedarfsanalyse-Tabelle, die Sie bspw. unter Objekte → B Prozesse & Informationen → Projektdurchführung → Fiktive Testdaten → Tabellen → Schutzbedarfsanalyse finden, integriert. Die Maßnahmenzuordnung kann auf drei Wegen erfolgen: Manuell Automatisiert Vorkonfiguration Synchronisation In der Demo haben wir die Synchronisation vorbereitet. Die Zuordnung von umzusetzenden Sicherheitsanforderungen und Maßnahmen zu den betroffenen Objekten erfolgt über eine Synchronisationsfunktion. Dazu werden ihnen vorbereitend die jeweils relevanten Objektklassen (Zielobjekte) zugeordnet. In einem weiteren Schritt können Synchronisationsobjekte definiert werden. Um nicht für jedes Objekt eine eigene (zu bearbeitende) Maßnahmenliste zu erzeugen, kann ein Strukturobjekt im Hierarchiebaum gewählt werden, das alle unterlagerten Objekte zusammenfasst. Bei der Synchronisation wird analysiert, welche Objektklasse(n) dem vorliegenden Objekt zugeordnet sind (eigene Objektklasse und ggf. hierarchisch unterlagerte Objektklassen). Anhand dieser Auswertung werden die Maßnahmen des zentralen Katalogs entweder auf Ebene des Strukturobjekts oder auf Einzelobjektebene synchronisiert. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Eine bedeutsame Schnittmenge stellt dabei das Vorfallmanagement dar. An die Organisation des Vorfallmanagements werden im Anhang A Anforderungen zur Erfassung und Behandlung von Informationssicherheitsvorfällen gestellt. Dieses beinhaltet die Beschreibung des Verfahrens, einen etablierten Meldeprozess, eine zügige Bearbeitung und Beurteilung der Meldungen, eine dem Vorfall entsprechende Reaktion, eine Analyse und Lösungen der Vorfälle. Ein ISMS beinhaltet den Betrieb der Informationssysteme. So fordert die DIN ISO/IEC 27001, dass die betrieblichen Prozesse, die für den sicheren Betrieb notwendig sind, nicht nur umgesetzt sondern auch gesteuert werden müssen. Dazu gehören neben den konkreten Aufgaben, die sich aus den Sicherheitsanforderungen ergeben, auch die Aufgaben aus den Bereichen Wartung, Instandsetzung, Erweiterungen und Änderungen. xmera Omnia unterstützt den gesamten Prozess des Vorfallmanagements. Dazu gehört die automatisierte Zuordnung von eingehenden Meldungen zu einzelnen Mitarbeitern oder Gruppen, die Priorisierung und Gruppierung sowie die Analyse des Vorfalls. Automatisieren In der xmera Omnia Demo ist die Meldungserfassung abgebildet. Meldungen können, genau wie Aufgaben, automatisch einem Bearbeiter oder einer Bearbeitergruppe zugewiesen werden. Die Erstellung einer Meldung kann im System selbst erfolgen oder per E-Mail an das System gesendet werden. Der E-Mail-Empfang ist in der Testinstanz nicht verfügbar. Besteht bereits eine Lösung für das Vorfallmangement (z.B. Ticketsystem) kann über die E-Mail- oder API-Schnittstelle von xmera Omnia eine Kopplung der Systeme erreicht werden. Priorisieren und Gruppieren Die einlaufende Meldung kann je nach Beurteilung anschließend als Aufgabe, Störung oder Vorfall eingestuft werden. Dieser können dann noch sich ergebende Unteraufgaben zugeordnet werden. Der Vorfall läßt sich über die Priorisierung und Kategorisierung weiter strukturieren. Durch Verknüpfungen zu anderen Vorfällen lassen sich auch ähnliche Vorfälle zusammenfassen. Über die Funktion Eigene Felder lassen sich leicht weitere Felder in eine Aufgabe integrieren und so an den Nutzer anpassen. Analysieren Zur Analyse ist in xmera Omnia die 5-W-Methode (5-Why-Methode nach Toyoda Sakichi) implementiert. Dabei wird in 5 Frageschritten der Vorfall aus verschiedenen Aspekten beleuchtet. Ziel ist es, Maßnahmen zu finden, die präventiv einen solchen Vorfall verhindern oder die Auswirkungen verringern. Diese Maßnahmen können wiederum als Unteraufgabe dem Vorfall zugeordnet werden. xmera Omnia bietet mit im Rahmen des Aufgabenmanagements die Möglichkeit aus den Maßnahmen der Sicherheitsanforderungen, der Risikobewertung, der Vorfallanalyse oder den Audits betrieblich umzusetzende Aufgaben zu erstellen und zu überwachen. Planen Aufgaben können bspw. als Abfolge (Vorgänger, Nachfolger) oder unabhängig geplant werden. Sie können zu Arbeitspaketen zusammengefasst werden, um so die Umsetzung einzelner Meilensteine besser beobachten und steuern zu können. Zu jeder Art von Aufgabe lassen sich Unteraufgaben, Kopien oder Verknüpfungen zu bestehenden Aufgaben erstellen. Somit lassen sich Beziehungen zwischen Aufgaben abbilden. Wiederholende Aufgaben planen Sie mit dem gleichnamigen Modul, das in jedem Objekt aktiviert werden kann. Delegieren Aufgaben können Mitarbeitern oder auch Gruppen zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann sich im Dashboard \"seine Aufgaben\" anzeigen lassen und erhält damit eine Übersicht auf seine offenen Arbeiten. Im Benutzerprofil hat jeder Mitarbeiter die Möglichkeit eine Option für die automatische E-Mailbenachrichtigung zu wählen, um über Änderungen im System benachrichtigt zu werden. Überwachen In jeder Aufgabe kann der Status und der Umsetzungsgrad dargestellt werden. Diese Werte werden auch an die untergeordneten Aufgaben übertragen. Ein Status einer (Eltern-)Aufgabe kann wiederum vom Status der unterlagerten Aufgaben abhängig gemacht werden. Da xmera Omnia auf einem klassischen Projektmanagementsystem basiert, ist das Ticketsystem integraler Bestandteil. So basieren die Maßnahmen, Risikobeurteilungen oder Aufgaben im engeren Sinne auf diesem Ticketsystem. In der Administration können weitere Aufgabentypen, Bezeichnungen für (Ticket-)Formulare, angelegt und über eigene Felder erweitert werden. Auf diese Weise können auch weitere Prozesse, wie z.B. das Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia integriert werden.

Im Kapitel 6 der ISO/IEC 27001 wird vorgegeben, dass alle Maßnahmen zur Erreichung der Sicherheitsziele zu planen und deren Umsetzung zu überwachen sind. Die Organisation und die getroffenen Maßnahmen sind nach Kapiltel 9 zu bewerten und deren Umsetzung zu überwachen. Anwendbarkeitserklärung Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil eines ISMS ist die Erklärung zur Anwendbarkeit (Statement of Applicability | SOA), in der die Sicherheitsanforderungen zusammengefasst werden, die zur Erreichung der Sicherheitsziele der Organisation relevant sind. Der Katalog der Sicherheitsanforderungen ist dem Anhang A der DIN ISO/IEC 27001 zu entnehmen. Die sich aus den Anforderungen ergebenden Maßnahmen werden ergänzt um weitere Maßnahmen aus eigenen Sicherheitsstandards, der Risikobewertung, der Vorfallanalyse oder internen wie externen Audits. Die Umsetzung der Maßnahmen ist zu überwachen und ihr Umsetzungsgrad zu ermitteln. xmera Omnia bietet den Anforderungskatalog als Importpaket gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27001 Anhang A an, der um individuelle Anforderungen erweitert werden kann. Interne Audits Im Kapitel 9.2 und im Anhang A.12.7 wird die Planung von internen Audits gefordert, in denen überprüft wird, ob die ISMS Prozesse die Anforderungen an die IT-Sicherheit erfüllen und wirksam sind. Der Anforderungskatalog kann an zentraler Stelle importiert und verwaltet werden. Von hier aus können Maßnahmen manuell oder automatisiert auf Assets der Organisation verteilt werden. Durch die Verknüpfung der zentralen Maßnahmenliste mit den operativ dezentral durchzuführenden Maßnahmen, kann der Reifegrad zentral überwacht werden. Die Begründung zur Relevanz von Sicherheitsanforderungen kann direkt in der Sicherheitsanforderung abgebildet werden. Die Anwendbarkeitserklärung kann zur weiteren Verarbeitung oder Vorlage beim Auditor exportiert werden. Status und Umsetzungsgrad Aus dem Anforderungskatalog sind Maßnahmen abzuleiten, zu planen, zu deligieren und zu überwachen. Zu jeder Maßnahme lassen sich Status und Umsetzungsgrad vom Verantwortlichen angeben, wodurch der Informationssicherheitsbeauftragte jederzeit einen Überblick über den Fortschritt erhält. Auswertungen kann er sowohl auf Ebene eines einzelnen Assets vornehmen als auch auf der Ebene von übergeordneten Objekten. In der obersten Ebene erhält er einen Überblick über das gesamte System. Um die Übersichtlichkeit zu erhöhen, lassen sich Aufgabenpakete bilden. Sie fassen Maßnahmen und zugehörige Aufgaben zusammen. Auch bei Aufgabenpaketen werden unterlagerte Maßnahmen und Aufgaben kumuliert dargestellt, so dass auch hier leicht ein Umsetzungsgrad überwacht werden kann. Verknüpfung zwischen Maßnahmen und Aufgaben Maßnahmen können auf verschiedenste Weise verknüpft werden. Der Bearbeitungstatus und der Umsetzungsgrad von untergeordneten Aufgaben ist in den übergeordneten Elementen zu sehen und kann den Status und den Umsetzungsgrad des übergeordneten Elements beeinflussen. Tabellarische und graphische Auswertung Zur Priorisierung und Umsetzungsüberwachung bietet xmera Omnia mehrere Möglichkeiten der Datenauswertung. Dabei unterstützen Filterfunktionen und eine flexible Spaltenanordnung innerhalb der Tabellen. Zusätzliche graphische Auswertungen runden die Analyse ab. Die Maßnahmenzuordnung kann auf drei Wegen erfolgen: Manuell Automatisiert Vorkonfiguration Synchronisation In der Demo haben wir die Synchronisation vorbereitet. Die Zuordnung von umzusetzenden Sicherheitsanforderungen und Maßnahmen zu den betroffenen Objekten erfolgt über eine Synchronisationsfunktion. Dazu werden ihnen vorbereitend die jeweils relevanten Objektklassen (Zielobjekte) zugeordnet. In einem weiteren Schritt können Synchronisationsobjekte definiert werden. Um nicht für jedes Objekt eine eigene (zu bearbeitende) Maßnahmenliste zu erzeugen, kann ein Strukturobjekt im Hierarchiebaum gewählt werden, das alle unterlagerten Objekte zusammenfasst. Bei der Synchronisation wird analysiert, welche Objektklasse(n) dem vorliegenden Objekt zugeordnet sind (eigene Objektklasse und ggf. hierarchisch unterlagerte Objektklassen). Anhand dieser Auswertung werden die Maßnahmen des zentralen Katalogs entweder auf Ebene des Strukturobjekts oder auf Einzelobjektebene synchronisiert. Für die Auswertung von Aufgaben, wie bspw.

Berichte / Zusammenfassung In den Aufgabenlisten der Objekte können über die Funktion Zusammenfassung Berichte aufgerufen werden, die in Form von Graphiken und Tabellen verschiedene Informationen darstellen. Die graphischen Auswertungen lassen sich auch im Dashboard anzeigen. Im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS) gibt es in vielen Bereichen wiederkehrende Aufgaben. Typische Aktivitäten zum Aufbau und Betrieb eines ISMS sind beispielsweise: Monatliche Besprechung und Abstimmung im ISMS-Team Jährliche Überprüfung, Aktualisierung und Fortschreibung der Informationssicherheitsleitlinie Vierteljährliche Überprüfung der Zutrittsrechte Jährliche [Auditplanung] uvm. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie beliebig viele Aufgaben mit individuellen Wiederholungszyklen planen. Zudem können Sie jede wiederkehrende Aufgabe einer Person zuordnen, einen Fertigstellungstermin und die Bearbeitungsdauer planen. Da die Funktion der Wiederholende Aufgaben als Objektmodul konzipiert ist, können Sie sie in jedem beliebigen Objekt aktivieren. Dadurch lassen sich Wiederholende Aufgaben auch gut im [IT-Servicemanagement] einsetzen. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie auch Audits planen und durchführen. Zu den Hilfsmitteln gehören Aufgaben, deren Inhalt um eigene Felder wie z.B. Auditfragen oder Ergebnisse ergänzt werden können, Terminplanungen, Zuordnung von Verantwortlichkeiten, Folgende Funktionen unterstützen bei der Auditplanung und -durchführung. Paket / Stapel Mit der Zuordnung der Aufgaben zu Arbeitspaketen, basierend auf dem Jahresdatum oder dem Zertifizierungszyklus, können die durchzuführenden Audits strukturiert werden. Verlauf und Kalender Mit den Funktionen Kalender und Verlauf lassen sich die geplanten und umgesetzten Audits chronologisch darstellen. Über diesen Weg wird die Planung und der aktuelle Auditstatus besonders übersichtlich. Wiederholende Aufgaben Mit dem Objektmodul der Wiederkehrenden Aufgaben lassen sich im Rahmen der Auditplanung und -durchführung alle Aufgaben, die sich z.B. jährlich wiederholen auf unbestimmte Zeit vorausplanen.

Hat ein Asset einen Schutzbedarf, der eine weitergehende Analyse erfordert (zumeist Hoch oder Sehr Hoch), so ist eine Risikobewertung durchzuführen. Gegenstand der Bewertung sind die Einschätzung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadenhöhe für ein sicherheitsrelevantes Ereignis. Der berechnete Wert ist das aktuelle Risiko für das vorliegende Ereignis. Dieses Risiko wird dem Risikoappetit der Organisation gegenüber gestellt. Anhand der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix wird über die Risikobehandlung des zugrunde liegenden Ereignisses entschieden. Die sich daraus ergebenden Maßnahmen sind zu definieren und zu priorisieren. Basis für die Risikobeurteilungen in xmera Omnia sind Gefährdungen. Gefährdungen beschreiben verschiedene Bedrohungsarten und verknüpfen sie mit einer potentiellen Schwachstelle. xmera Omnia bietet ein Importpaket des Gefährdungskataloges gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27005 oder IT-Grundschutz an, das um individuelle Gefährdungen erweitert werden kann. Jede Gefährdung kann verschiedenen Objektklassen zugeordnet werden. Über den Synchronisationsprozess werden die Gefährdungen dann einem Asset oder einer Assetgruppe zugeordnet. Die Risikobewertung erfolgt auf Basis von zugeordneten Gefährdungen. Durch Festlegung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadensklasse wird über die Risikoakzeptanzmatrix ein resultierendes Risiko ermittelt. Risikoakzeptanzmatrix Für die Ermittlung des Risikoniveaus wird in xmera Omnia eine individuell konfigurierbare Risikoakzeptanzmatrix bereitgestellt, in der für jede Kombination aus Eintrittshäufigkeit und Schadensklasse ein Risikoniveau zugeordnet werden kann. In der Demo wird hierfür eine 4 x 4 Matrix verwendet, woraus sich 16 Kombinationen ergeben. Da die Konfiguration der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix im Administrationsbereich vorgenommen werden muss, ist eine Anpassung im Rahmen der Demo nicht möglich. Risikobehandlung Die gewählte Risikobehandlungsoption und das sich daraus ergebende neue Risikoniveau lassen sich ebenfalls in der Risikobeurteilung abbilden. Wird eine Maßnahme erforderlich, kann diese direkt erstellt und mit der Risikobeurteilung verknüpft werden. Wird ein Risikoniveau durch eine Maßnahme reduziert oder vermieden, so kann die Maßnahmen als Unteraufgabe an die Gefährdung gekoppelt werden. Alle Maßnahmen, die aus einer Risikobeurteilung erwachsen sind, können dann in einem Risikobehandlungsplan zusammengefasst werden. Der Risikobehandlungsplan zeigt alle Maßnahmen, die als Ziel haben, dass Schutzniveau auf ein akzeptables Maß zu bringen. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Sie dient zur Identifizierung von Unternehmenswerten, die besonders geschützt werden müssen, weil sie kritisch (existenziell) für den Fortbestand der Organisation sind. Diese Informationssicherheitsbeurteilung beinhaltet eine erste grobe Einschätzung wie sich verschiedene Informationssicherheitsereignisse in Bezug auf die Schutzziele Vertraulichkeit, Integrität und Verfügbarkeit auf die Organisation auswirken würden, wenn sie eintreten. Je nach Branche oder Sicherheitsstandard können/müssen weitere Schutzziele wie bspw. Authentizität oder Nichtabstreitbarkeit in die Beurteilung einbezogen werden. Die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung in xmera Omnia ermöglicht die Beurteilung des Schutzbedarfs anhand eines Fragenkatalogs. Dieser Fragenkatalog kann individuell angepasst werden. Somit lässt sich zum Beispiel direkt durch die Prozesseigner der Schutzbedarf für die von ihnen benötigten Informationen ermitteln. Aufwendige Interviews entfallen. Der Schutzbedarf der sekundären Assets, wie z.B. Anwendungen, Desktop-PC’s, Server oder auch Serverräume und Gebäude, ist abhängig von den in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Über die Struktur der logischen Verknüpfungen im Assetregister lassen sich die Schutzbedarfe der primären Assets (Prozesse und Informationen) auf die sekundären Assets übertragen. Somit haben die Verantwortlichen dieser Assets jederzeit einen Überblick über den Schutzbedarf, der in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Der Schutzbedarf des Assets wird mit dem Maximalprinzip ermittelt und kann im Rahmen der Schutzbedarfsfeststellung der Assets übernommen werden. Wenn wegen dem Kumulations- oder Verteilungseffekt vom sonst üblichen Maximumprinzip vom automatisch übertragenen Schutzbedarf abgewichen werden muss, dann ist das in xmera Omnia an jeder Stelle in der Vererbungskette möglich. Ausfüllhilfen für Mitarbeiter Definitionen von Fachbegriffen wie dem Kumulations- und Verteilungseffekt finden Sie in der Demo beispielhaft unter Objekte → I Vorgaben & Regeln → Wiki → ISMS-Handbuch → 2.

Dazu gehört, dass geplante Änderungen überwacht werden. Je nach Komplexität solcher Änderungen, wie z.B. bei größeren Upgrades, Erneuerungen oder der Einführung neuer IT-Prozesse, ist ein Projektmanagement sinnvoll oder notwendig. Import-/Exportfunktionen Viele Prozesse einer Organisation haben Schnittmengen mit dem ISMS, werden aber nicht im ISMS abgebildet. Sei es die Dokumentation für den externen Auditor, Daten für eine Analyse oder einen Bericht oder ein externes Asset-Register. Hier ist es sinnvoll Schnittstellen, wie z.B. ein Datenimport- und -exportprozess auf Basis von CSV-Tabellen ein PDF-Ausdruck oder eine API-Schnittstelle für einen Online-Datenaustausch. Rollen und Berechtigungen In einem ISMS Tool sind viele sensible Daten abgebildet. Gleichzeitig sind viele Mitarbeiter an der Pflege beteiligt. Die ISMS Software sollte ein Berechtigungssystem bereitstellen, dass hier mit größtmöglicher Flexibilität die Zugriffe auf das System steuern kann. xmera Omnia basiert im Kern auf einem Projektmanagementsystem. Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat. Über Meldungen lassen sich Informationen im Projektteam verteilen. Über Foren lassen sich Diskussionsrunden abbilden. Über das Wiki kann Projektwissen dokumentiert und weitergeben werden. xmera Omnia bietet verschiedene Schnittstellen an, die den Austausch mit externen Systemen oder Personen ermöglichen. PDF-Export Der PDF-Export bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgabenlisten, den Verlauf oder Wiki-Seiten als PDF-Datei herunterzuladen. Wiki-Seiten können auch als HTML-Datei oder Text-Datei heruntergeladen werden. CSV-Schnittstelle Die CSV-Schnittstelle ermöglicht einen manuellen Austausch von Listen. Exportiert werden können die Abfragelisten der Objekte und Aufgaben. Dabei ist eine individuelle Anpassung der zu übertragenden Attribute möglich. Die CSV-Importschnittstelle ermöglicht es Aufgaben zu importieren. Das können Maßnahmenkataloge aus eigenen Vorgaben oder anderen Standards oder auch Aufgaben aus einem anderen Ticket-Systemen sein, die in das System integriert werden sollen. API / E-Mail Schnittstelle Dynamischer sind dabei die Online-Schnittstellen wie die E-Mail-Kopplung oder die API, über die dynamisch externe Systeme integriert werden können. Die E-Mail-Schnittstelle ermöglicht es, eingehende E-Mails in eine Aufgabe zu wandeln. Bei der Einhaltung der Format-Regeln, können die E-Mails konkreten Objekten und definierten Aufgabentypen zugeordnet werden. Die API-Schnittstelle in xmera Omnia ermöglicht einen Datenaustausch bei Objekten, Aufgaben und Benutzern. Dabei wird das Anlegen, Ändern, Löschen oder auch Archivieren unterstützt. Die API-Schnittstelle unterstützt dabei sowohl das xml- als auch json-Format. Berechtigungen werden in xmera Omnia auf Ebene der Objekte verwaltet. Zugriff auf ein Objekt erhalten nur jene Benutzer, die dem Objekt zugeordnet wurden. Die Zuordnung wird in der Objektkonfiguration vorgenommen. Dabei wird für einem Benutzer oder eine Gruppe eine passende Rolle gewählt. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, ein Objekt öffentlich zu machen. Damit kann jeder angemeldete Benutzer im System automatisch auf dieses Objekt zugreifen. Die Benutzer, Gruppen und Rollen werden in der Administration gepflegt. Es besteht die Möglichkeit der LDAP-Kopplung. Somit kann zentral festgelegt werden, welche Benutzer Zutritt zum System haben sollen. Der Objektverantwortliche legt dann fest, welche Benutzer mit welchen Rechten als Mitglied auf ein Objekt zugreifen können. Zur Vereinfachung der Mitgliederverwaltung können die Mitglieder vom übergeordneten Objekt geerbt werden. Your browser does not support the video tag. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat.

Gleichzeitig lässt Ihnen die Demo genug Raum eigene Daten testweise einzupflegen. Das Rollen- und Rechtemanagement ist eine wichtige Funktionalität eines ISMS-Tools. So sind in der Demo folgende Rollen als Beispiel hinterlegt: Objektverantwortlicher Überwachungsverantwortlicher Aufgabenverantwortlicher Risikoverantwortlicher Beobachter Meldungsberechtigter Disponent Diese Rollen können innerhalb eines Objektes dem Benutzer oder einer Benutzergruppe zugewiesen werden. Damit erhält ein Benutzer Rechte in einem oder mehreren Objekten. Objekte und Elemente, an denen ein Benutzer keine Rechte besitzt, werden ihm nicht angezeigt und sind somit auch nicht zugänglich. Der Benutzer demo-tester ist in allen Objekten Objektverantwortlicher. Damit sieht er alles und kann auch Konfigurationen in den Objekten anpassen.

Nach der Bestätigung wird eine Liste der Suchergebnisse angezeigt. Die Suche kann in diesem Fenster auf definierte Objekte eingegrenzt werden. Klickt man in das Feld Schnellzugriff (Zu einem Objekt springen), wird eine Liste der zuletzt verwendeten Objekte und aller übrigen Objekte angezeigt. Durch einen Klick auf das gewünschte Objekt springt man gleich in das Übersichtsfenster des ausgewählten Objekts. Auf Meine Seite kann sich der Benutzer ein Dashboard mit den für ihn wichtigen Informationen zusammenstellen. Über das Feld Hinzufügen kann man verschiedene Blöcke in die Seite integrieren. Diese Blöcke lassen sich wiederum bearbeiten. Bei einem Mouseover wird im oberen rechten Bereich des Blocks eine Bearbeitungsleiste eingeblendet. Bei Klick auf das Zahnrad (steht nicht bei allen Blöcken zur Auswahl) können Einstellungen am Block vorgenommen werden. Der gekreuzte Pfeil kennzeichnet die Drag & Drop Funktion. Bei gehaltener linker Maustaste kann der Block verschoben werden (siehe Bild unten) und bei Klick auf das Kreuz wird der Block entfernt. Auf diese Weise kann sich der Benutzer seine Seite gestalten. Unter dem Menüpunkt Objekte befindet sich der Bereich, in dem die Datenbearbeitung erfolgt. In der Demo wird folgendes Fenster angezeigt. In der Objektübersicht sind die Wurzelobjekte zu sehen. In der Demo werden folgende Wurzelelemente genutzt: A Management: Abbildung der Prozesse des ISMS-Managementprozess B Prozesse & Informationen: Erfassung und Bewertung der Organisationsprozesse und der Informationen, die für Informationsprozesse benötigt werden C Services: Darstellung zu internen und externen Dienstleistern D IT-Betrieb: Abbildung der IT-Anwendungen, IT-Systeme, Netzwerke E Infrastruktur: Abbildung von Standorten, Gebäuden, Räumen F Audit: Abbildung der internen und externen Audits G Changeprozesse: Abbildung von Projekten im Bereich der Informationsverarbeitung (es könnten aber auch beliebige Projekte sein) H Meldungen: Erfassen und Verarbeiten von Service-Tickets, Störungen und Vorfällen I Vorgaben & Regeln Zentraler Ort für übergreifende Reglungen und Vorgaben der Organisation Diese Struktur ist demo-spezifisch und sollte an die Erfordernisse der Organisation angepasst werden.

Hierzu sind für die Einführung eines ISMS - der Projektauftrag, - die Rollen, - die Ziele, - die Projektplanung und - die Kommunikationsstruktur festzulegen. Dabei ist für ein ISMS nach CISIS 12 die Anwendbarkeitserklärung (SOA) von zentraler Bedeutung. Sie definiert die Grenzen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems. In CISIS 12 helfen bei der Definition der SOA die Bausteingruppen. Nicht relevante Bausteingruppen können mit nachvollziehbarer Begründung ausgeschlossen werden. Der 1. Schritt ist die Erstellung einer Leitlinie, in die grundlegende Festlegungen wie z.B. die Verantwortlichkeiten oder der Geltungsbereich für das ISMS definiert sind. In Schritt 2 geht es um die Sensibilisierung der Beschäftigten. Es sind Maßnahmen zu planen, die das Bewusstsein (Awareness) der MitarbeiterInnen für das Thema Informationssicherheit erhöhen. In Schritt 3 ist das ISMS-Team zu benennen, das den Aufbau, die Aufrechterhaltung und die Verbesserung der ISMS Prozesse verantwortet. Das Einführungsprojekt ist mit Hilfe der Projektmanagement-Funktionen im Bereich Management » ISMS » Implementierung ISMS abgebildet. Jeder CISIS 12 Schritt ist geplant, beschrieben und terminiert. Den einzelnen Schritten können weitere Aufgaben zugeordnet werden. Die Funktionen Aufgabenmanagement Dokumentenmanagement Verlauf Paket und Stapel unterstützen bei der Durchführung und Überwachung des Projekts. xmera Omnia integriert die CISIS 12 Bausteine. Jeder Baustein ist mit seinem Ziel und den dazugehörigen Maßnahmen abgebildet. Der Aufbau eines einzelnen Bausteins erlaubt diverse Filtermöglichkeiten wie bspw. nach den Modalverben Muss, Soll, Kann. Mit den Bausteinen hat jeder Maßnahmenverantwortliche alle relevanten Informationen des CISIS 12-Kataloges direkt im Zugriff und kann so die Maßnahmen zielgerichtet umsetzen. Weiter wird durch Gliederung nach Bausteinen (z.B. in der Anwendbarkeitserklärung) und Filterung oder Sortierung nach der Relevanz die Übersichtlichkeit erheblich verbessert. Der Anforderungskatalog kann an zentraler Stelle importiert und verwaltet werden. Von hier aus können Maßnahmen manuell oder automatisiert auf Assets der Organisation verteilt werden. Durch die Verknüpfung der zentralen Maßnahmenliste mit den operativ dezentral durchzuführenden Maßnahmen, kann der Reifegrad zentral überwacht werden. Die Begründung zur Relevanz von Sicherheitsanforderungen kann direkt in der Sicherheitsanforderung abgebildet werden. Die Anwendbarkeitserklärung kann zur weiteren Verarbeitung oder Vorlage beim Auditor exportiert werden. xmera Omnia bietet mit dem Modul DMS ein Dokumentenmanagementsystem, mit dem die Zugänglichkeit und Änderbarkeit von Dokumenten gesteuert, Dokumente strukturiert und klassifiziert, Änderungen versioniert und Freigaben über einen Genehmigungsworkflow organisiert und dokumentiert werden können. Das DMS Modul ist in jedem Objekt verfügbar und kann bei Bedarf aktiviert werden. Zugriffssteuerung Dokumente, die für alle Mitarbeiter relevant sind, können in einem eigens dafür vorgesehenen Objekt zentral verwaltet und zugänglich gemacht werden. Der Zugriff auf Dokumente, die dagegen nur für bestimmte Interessensgruppen relevant sind, kann durch eine entsprechende Rechtevergabe gesteuert werden. Das ist sowohl zentral als auch dezentral in Objekten, die als Arbeitsbereiche, Assets oder Projekte genutzt werden, möglich. Durch zuordnen der Dokumente zu Ordnern sowie durch (administrativ erstellbare) Attribute lassen sich die Dokumente leicht strukturieren. Mit Hilfe von Verknüpfungen einzelner Dokumente zu anderen Elementen in xmera Omnia können Dokumente übergreifend den berechtigten Nutzern zugänglich gemacht werden. Versionierung Zentraler Bestandteil des DMS ist die Versionierung. Dokumente, die mit ihren Metadaten erfasst wurden, können nicht direkt verändert werden. Änderungen müssen in einer neuen Version erfolgen. Damit ist eine Änderungsverfolgung jeder Änderung des Dokuments einschließlich seiner Metadaten möglich. Zusätzlich können Dokumente auch vor ungewollten Änderungen geschützt werden. Genehmigungsworkflow Das DMS in xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit, die Freigabe von Dokumenten über einen Genehmigungsworkflow durchzuführen und zu dokumentieren. Ein Genehmigungsworkflow beschreibt den Ablauf des Freigabeprozesses. In xmera Omnia können verschiedene Freigabeprozesse (z.B. für Richtlinien, Handlungsanweisungen oder Betriebshandbücher) abgebildet werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Status und Umsetzungsgrad Aus dem Anforderungskatalog sind Maßnahmen abzuleiten, zu planen, zu deligieren und zu überwachen. Zu jeder Maßnahme lassen sich Status und Umsetzungsgrad vom Verantwortlichen angeben, wodurch der Informationssicherheitsbeauftragte jederzeit einen Überblick über den Fortschritt erhält. Auswertungen kann er sowohl auf Ebene eines einzelnen Assets vornehmen als auch auf der Ebene von übergeordneten Objekten. In der obersten Ebene erhält er einen Überblick über das gesamte System. Um die Übersichtlichkeit zu erhöhen, lassen sich Aufgabenpakete bilden. Sie fassen Maßnahmen und zugehörige Aufgaben zusammen. Auch bei Aufgabenpaketen werden unterlagerte Maßnahmen und Aufgaben kumuliert dargestellt, so dass auch hier leicht ein Umsetzungsgrad überwacht werden kann. Verknüpfung zwischen Maßnahmen und Aufgaben Maßnahmen können auf verschiedenste Weise verknüpft werden.

Planen Aufgaben können bspw. als Abfolge (Vorgänger, Nachfolger) oder unabhängig geplant werden. Sie können zu Arbeitspaketen zusammengefasst werden, um so die Umsetzung einzelner Meilensteine besser beobachten und steuern zu können. Zu jeder Art von Aufgabe lassen sich Unteraufgaben, Kopien oder Verknüpfungen zu bestehenden Aufgaben erstellen. Somit lassen sich Beziehungen zwischen Aufgaben abbilden. Wiederholende Aufgaben planen Sie mit dem gleichnamigen Modul, das in jedem Objekt aktiviert werden kann. Delegieren Aufgaben können Mitarbeitern oder auch Gruppen zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann sich im Dashboard \"seine Aufgaben\" anzeigen lassen und erhält damit eine Übersicht auf seine offenen Arbeiten. Im Benutzerprofil hat jeder Mitarbeiter die Möglichkeit eine Option für die automatische E-Mailbenachrichtigung zu wählen, um über Änderungen im System benachrichtigt zu werden. Überwachen In jeder Aufgabe kann der Status und der Umsetzungsgrad dargestellt werden. Diese Werte werden auch an die untergeordneten Aufgaben übertragen. Ein Status einer (Eltern-)Aufgabe kann wiederum vom Status der unterlagerten Aufgaben abhängig gemacht werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Ziel dieser Dokumentation ist, dass ein fachkundiger Dritter in die Lage versetzt wird, den IT-Betrieb fortzuführen. Zentraler Bestandteil der Dokumentation sind Prozesse und Richtlinien zur Sicherstellung der IT-Sicherheit und des ISMS, die Dokumentation aller Maßnahmen aus Risikoanalyse, Audits, Vorfallanalysen und Revisionen, das Betriebshandbuch mit Prozesssteckbriefen, Netzplänen, IT-Servicehandbuch und Systemakten, das Notfallhandbuch. xmera Omnia unterstützt den Nutzer bei der Dokumentation und Arbeitsorganisation und sorgt dabei für Struktur und Ordnung. Objekte werden mit Hilfe von Objektklassen, die wie eine Vorlage funktionieren, in eine für die Organisation geeignete Objekthierarchie eingegliedert. Dabei kann die Struktur nach beliebigen Kriterien aufgebaut werden. Zu den wichtigsten Objekten gehören das ISMS-Projekt, in dem sich der Informationssicherheitsbeauftragte organisiert und das ISMS steuert, die Prozesse und Informationen, die der Ausgangspunkt für alle folgenden Maßnahmen sind und es ermöglichen Prozesse zu beschreiben sowie ihren Schutzbedarf zu bestimmen, die IT-Asset Objekte, die mit der hinterlegten Dokumentation die Systemsteckbriefe darstellen und alles für den Systembetrieb abbilden können. Mit Hilfe des übergreifenden Aufgabenmanagements werden alle notwendigen IT-Maßnahmen gesteuert und überwacht. Dabei stehen in jedem Objekt verschiedene Dokumentationsmodule zur Verfügung, die den Nutzer bei der Dokumentation unterstützen. Dazu gehören das Dokumentenmanagementmodul (DMS) (beschrieben in Kapitel CISIS 12 Start), die Module Dokumente und Dateien und das Wiki. Diese werden im Folgenden beschrieben: Wenn für die Pflege von Dokumenten, die einem Objekt zugeordnet werden, keine Funktionen wie die Versionierung, der Freigabeworkflow oder komplexere Ordnerstrukturen benötigt werden, bieten sich die xmera Omnia Module Datei und Dokumente an. Dateien Das Modul Dateien ermöglicht es, einem Objekt Dateien zuzuordnen. Die Liste beinhaltet den Dateinamen, das Datum der Zuordnung, die Anzahl der Downloads (D/L), sowie die sha256 Prüfsumme. Über eine Tooltip wird eine Dateibeschreibung, die beim Upload erfasst wird, dargestellt. Inhalte einfacher Textdateien können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. Dokumente Das Modul Dokumente bietet die Möglichkeit, einem Objekt eine oder mehrere Dokumentensammlungen zuzuordnen. Eine Dokumentensammlung wird charakterisiert durch eine Dokumentenkategorie (Kategorien können über die Administration angepasst werden), eine Dokumentenbeschreibung und eine oder mehrere zugeordnete Dateien (mit einer Dateibeschreibung). Die Dokumentensammlungen lassen sich nach der Dokumentenkategorie, dem Zuordnungsdatum, dem Dokumententitel oder dem Autor (Benutzer der das Dokument angelegt hat) gruppieren. Dokumente können heruntergeladen werden. Inhalte einfacher Textdokumente können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. In jedem Objekt in xmera Omnia kann das Modul Wiki aktiviert werden. Dieses bietet alle typischen Funktionalitäten eines Wiki. Es ermöglicht Informationen und Wissen kollaborativ zu bearbeiten und zu benutzen. Es eignet sich im Umfeld des ISMS, um Handbücher bereitzustellen oder auch Prozess- / Handlungsbeschreibungen zu einem Asset zu dokumentieren. Diagramme und Flowcharts xmera Omnia integriert Drawio (https://www.diagrams.net/) für das Erstellen von Diagrammen und Flowcharts, die in das Wiki integriert werden können. So erstellen Sie leicht verständliche Prozessablaufpläne, bspw. im Rahmen des Notfallmanagements. Auch Netzpläne sind mit Hilfe der zahlreichen Bibliotheken zügig erstellt. Interne Links / Makros Mit Hilfe von internen Verlinkungen und Makros lassen sich Inhalte aus anderen Modulen wie z.B. Dokumente, Aufgaben oder Wikiseiten aus anderen Objekten in einem Wiki übersichtlich zusammenfassen. Historie Die Historie zeigt alle Änderungen, die im Wiki durchgeführt wurden, inkl. dem Bearbeiter und Zeitpunkt. In Kombination mit dem Berechtigungssystem, in dem die Rechte zur Bearbeitung definiert werden können, ist die Dokumentation revisionierbar. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Das beinhaltet die Wartungprozesse, die Störungsprozesse und die Änderungsprozesse. Das Management ist an die Größe der Organisation anzupassen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist auch das Lieferantenmanagement, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit dem Outsourcing von ID-Diensten, zu betrachten. xmera Omnia unterstützt das IT-Servicemanagement in vielfältiger Weise. Die Wartungs- und Störungsprozesse können durch das Aufgaben/Ticket-Management gesteuert werden. Bei komplexeren Change-/Änderungsprozessen bietet sich das in xmera Omnia integrierte Projektmanagement an. xmera Omnia unterstützt den gesamten Prozess des Vorfallmanagements. Dazu gehört die automatisierte Zuordnung von eingehenden Meldungen zu einzelnen Mitarbeitern oder Gruppen, die Priorisierung und Gruppierung sowie die Analyse des Vorfalls. Automatisieren In der xmera Omnia Demo ist die Meldungserfassung abgebildet. Meldungen können, genau wie Aufgaben, automatisch einem Bearbeiter oder einer Bearbeitergruppe zugewiesen werden. Die Erstellung einer Meldung kann im System selbst erfolgen oder per E-Mail an das System gesendet werden. Der E-Mail-Empfang ist in der Testinstanz nicht verfügbar. Besteht bereits eine Lösung für das Vorfallmangement (z.B. Ticketsystem) kann über die E-Mail- oder API-Schnittstelle von xmera Omnia eine Kopplung der Systeme erreicht werden. Priorisieren und Gruppieren Die einlaufende Meldung kann je nach Beurteilung anschließend als Aufgabe, Störung oder Vorfall eingestuft werden. Dieser können dann noch sich ergebende Unteraufgaben zugeordnet werden. Der Vorfall läßt sich über die Priorisierung und Kategorisierung weiter strukturieren. Durch Verknüpfungen zu anderen Vorfällen lassen sich auch ähnliche Vorfälle zusammenfassen. Über die Funktion Eigene Felder lassen sich leicht weitere Felder in eine Aufgabe integrieren und so an den Nutzer anpassen. Analysieren Zur Analyse ist in xmera Omnia die 5-W-Methode (5-Why-Methode nach Toyoda Sakichi) implementiert. Dabei wird in 5 Frageschritten der Vorfall aus verschiedenen Aspekten beleuchtet. Ziel ist es, Maßnahmen zu finden, die präventiv einen solchen Vorfall verhindern oder die Auswirkungen verringern. Diese Maßnahmen können wiederum als Unteraufgabe dem Vorfall zugeordnet werden. Da xmera Omnia auf einem klassischen Projektmanagementsystem basiert, ist das Ticketsystem integraler Bestandteil. So basieren die Maßnahmen, Risikobeurteilungen oder Aufgaben im engeren Sinne auf diesem Ticketsystem. In der Administration können weitere Aufgabentypen, Bezeichnungen für (Ticket-)Formulare, angelegt und über eigene Felder erweitert werden. Auf diese Weise können auch weitere Prozesse, wie z.B. das Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia integriert werden. Falls Sie die Umsetzung des Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia interessiert, sprechen Sie uns an. xmera Omnia basiert im Kern auf einem Projektmanagementsystem. Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat. Über Meldungen lassen sich Informationen im Projektteam verteilen. Über Foren lassen sich Diskussionsrunden abbilden. Über das Wiki kann Projektwissen dokumentiert und weitergeben werden.

Den kritischen Prozessen sind dann die notwendigen Anwendungen, IT-Assets und Infrastrukturen zuzuordnen. xmera Omnia bietet die Funktionalität zur Abbildung der in Schritt 6 geforderten Geschäftsprozessanalyse. Dabei können die Geschäftsprozesse und die zugehörigen Informationen abgebildet werden, um auf dieser Basis die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung durchzuführen. Geschäftsprozesse werden in xmera Omnia als Objekte dargestellt. Hierfür ist die Objektklasse Prozess vordefiniert und kann nach Bedarf angepasst werden. Über den hierarchischen Aufbau der Objekte können relevante Prozesse der Ablauforganisation abgebildet werden. Optional können dann die für den Betrieb des Prozesses notwendigen Informationsobjekte zugeordnet werden. Informationen sind die primären Assets einer Organisation. Sie dienen als Bindeglied zwischen Prozess und Anwendung. Der Prozess beschreibt eine Handlung. Eine Information kann sowohl zur Durchführung dieser Handlung notwendig, als auch ihr Erzeugnis sein. Bei der Erfassung von Informationen kann auf Informationsklassen zurückgegriffen werden, die eine Grundkonfiguration im Bereich der Schutzbedarfsfestlegung aber auch des Datenschutzes ermöglichen. Der Schutzbedarf der Information wird durch die Prozesseigner definiert. Dieser wird über die logischen Verknüpfungen zu den für die Informationsverarbeitung notwendigen sekundären Assets vererbt. Die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung in xmera Omnia ermöglicht die Beurteilung des Schutzbedarfs anhand eines Fragenkatalogs. Dieser Fragenkatalog kann individuell angepasst werden. Somit lässt sich zum Beispiel direkt durch die Prozesseigner der Schutzbedarf für die von ihnen benötigten Informationen ermitteln. Aufwendige Interviews entfallen. Die logischen Strukturen in xmera Omnia bilden die Abhängigkeiten der Objekte untereinander ab.

Diese Struktur soll die Verantwortlichkeiten (Asset-Owner) abbilden, die Basis für das Betriebshandbuch sein und einen fachkundigen Dritten eine Aufrechterhaltung des IT-Betriebs ermöglichen. Weiter muss der Schutzbedarf aus der in Schritt 6 durchgeführten Schutzbedarfsfeststellung für kritische Prozesse und Informationen auf die IT-Assets vererbt werden. Als dritte Aufgabe sind die Maßnahmen gemäß CISIS 12 Katalog den Assets zuzuordnen. Assets werden in xmera Omnia als Objekte erfasst. Diese Objekte können hierarchisch strukturiert werden. So können über den Hierarchiebaum beispielsweise die Aufbauorganisation und damit Verantwortlichkeiten der Organisation abgebildet werden. Alternativ könnten Assets mit gleichem Schutzbedarf analog zu räumlichen Sicherheitszonen im Hierarchiebaum zusammengefasst werden. Den Assets können Mitarbeiter zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann in der für ein spezifisches Asset passenden Rolle hinzugefügt werden. Dabei stehen die Rollen zur Verfügung, die über das Berechtigungsmanagement vom Administrator angelegt wurden. In der Demo sind das beispielsweise der Objektverantwortliche, Aufgabenverantwortliche, Risikoverantwortliche oder Beobachter. Neben den hierarchischen Strukturen können auch logische Verknüpfungen (Zusammenhänge zwischen den Objekten) abgebildet werden. Objektverknüpfungen bilden die Basis für die Vererbung des Schutzbedarfs, der in der Schutzbedarfsanalyse auf Ebene der Informationsobjekte oder Geschäftsprozesse ermittelt wird. Beispiel einer Vererbungskette Informationen → werden in einer Anwendung gepflegt → die auf einem Server läuft → der in einem Serverraum → in einem Werksgebäude steht. Über die logischen Strukturen lassen sich so Abhängigkeitsketten von der Information zu all den für die Informationsverarbeitung notwendigen Assets (Objekten) abbilden. Der Schutzbedarf der sekundären Assets, wie z.B. Anwendungen, Desktop-PC’s, Server oder auch Serverräume und Gebäude, ist abhängig von den in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Über die Struktur der logischen Verknüpfungen im Assetregister lassen sich die Schutzbedarfe der primären Assets (Prozesse und Informationen) auf die sekundären Assets übertragen. Somit haben die Verantwortlichen dieser Assets jederzeit einen Überblick über den Schutzbedarf, der in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Der Schutzbedarf des Assets wird mit dem Maximalprinzip ermittelt und kann im Rahmen der Schutzbedarfsfeststellung der Assets übernommen werden. Wenn wegen dem Kumulations- oder Verteilungseffekt vom sonst üblichen Maximumprinzip vom automatisch übertragenen Schutzbedarf abgewichen werden muss, dann ist das in xmera Omnia an jeder Stelle in der Vererbungskette möglich. Ausfüllhilfen für Mitarbeiter Definitionen von Fachbegriffen wie dem Kumulations- und Verteilungseffekt finden Sie in der Demo beispielhaft unter Objekte → I Vorgaben & Regeln → Wiki → ISMS-Handbuch → 2. Schutzbedarffeststellung. Diese haben wir als Ausfüllhilfe über der Schutzbedarfsanalyse-Tabelle, die Sie bspw. unter Objekte → B Prozesse & Informationen → Projektdurchführung → Fiktive Testdaten → Tabellen → Schutzbedarfsanalyse finden, integriert. Die Maßnahmenzuordnung kann auf drei Wegen erfolgen: Manuell Automatisiert Vorkonfiguration Synchronisation In der Demo haben wir die Synchronisation vorbereitet. Die Zuordnung von umzusetzenden Sicherheitsanforderungen und Maßnahmen zu den betroffenen Objekten erfolgt über eine Synchronisationsfunktion. Dazu werden ihnen vorbereitend die jeweils relevanten Objektklassen (Zielobjekte) zugeordnet. In einem weiteren Schritt können Synchronisationsobjekte definiert werden. Um nicht für jedes Objekt eine eigene (zu bearbeitende) Maßnahmenliste zu erzeugen, kann ein Strukturobjekt im Hierarchiebaum gewählt werden, das alle unterlagerten Objekte zusammenfasst. Bei der Synchronisation wird analysiert, welche Objektklasse(n) dem vorliegenden Objekt zugeordnet sind (eigene Objektklasse und ggf. hierarchisch unterlagerte Objektklassen). Anhand dieser Auswertung werden die Maßnahmen des zentralen Katalogs entweder auf Ebene des Strukturobjekts oder auf Einzelobjektebene synchronisiert. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Hierzu sind Regelungen zum Umgang mit Risiken, zur Risikobewertung, Risikobehandlung sowie Überwachung und Neubewertung notwendig, die in einer Richtlinie zusammengefasst werden. Basierend auf dieser Richtlinie sind dann die Risikoermittlung, Risikobehandlung (Risikobehandlungsplan) und die Überwachung durchzuführen. Basis für die Risikobeurteilungen in xmera Omnia sind Gefährdungen. Gefährdungen beschreiben verschiedene Bedrohungsarten und verknüpfen sie mit einer potentiellen Schwachstelle. xmera Omnia bietet ein Importpaket des Gefährdungskataloges gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27005 oder IT-Grundschutz an, das um individuelle Gefährdungen erweitert werden kann. Jede Gefährdung kann verschiedenen Objektklassen zugeordnet werden. Über den Synchronisationsprozess werden die Gefährdungen dann einem Asset oder einer Assetgruppe zugeordnet. Die Risikobewertung erfolgt auf Basis von zugeordneten Gefährdungen. Durch Festlegung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadensklasse wird über die Risikoakzeptanzmatrix ein resultierendes Risiko ermittelt. Risikoakzeptanzmatrix Für die Ermittlung des Risikoniveaus wird in xmera Omnia eine individuell konfigurierbare Risikoakzeptanzmatrix bereitgestellt, in der für jede Kombination aus Eintrittshäufigkeit und Schadensklasse ein Risikoniveau zugeordnet werden kann. In der Demo wird hierfür eine 4 x 4 Matrix verwendet, woraus sich 16 Kombinationen ergeben. Da die Konfiguration der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix im Administrationsbereich vorgenommen werden muss, ist eine Anpassung im Rahmen der Demo nicht möglich. Risikobehandlung Die gewählte Risikobehandlungsoption und das sich daraus ergebende neue Risikoniveau lassen sich ebenfalls in der Risikobeurteilung abbilden. Wird eine Maßnahme erforderlich, kann diese direkt erstellt und mit der Risikobeurteilung verknüpft werden. Wird ein Risikoniveau durch eine Maßnahme reduziert oder vermieden, so kann die Maßnahmen als Unteraufgabe an die Gefährdung gekoppelt werden. Alle Maßnahmen, die aus einer Risikobeurteilung erwachsen sind, können dann in einem Risikobehandlungsplan zusammengefasst werden. Der Risikobehandlungsplan zeigt alle Maßnahmen, die als Ziel haben, dass Schutzniveau auf ein akzeptables Maß zu bringen. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Typische Aktivitäten zum Aufbau und Betrieb eines ISMS sind beispielsweise: Monatliche Besprechung und Abstimmung im ISMS-Team Jährliche Überprüfung, Aktualisierung und Fortschreibung der Informationssicherheitsleitlinie Vierteljährliche Überprüfung der Zutrittsrechte Jährliche [Auditplanung] uvm. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie beliebig viele Aufgaben mit individuellen Wiederholungszyklen planen. Zudem können Sie jede wiederkehrende Aufgabe einer Person zuordnen, einen Fertigstellungstermin und die Bearbeitungsdauer planen. Da die Funktion der Wiederholende Aufgaben als Objektmodul konzipiert ist, können Sie sie in jedem beliebigen Objekt aktivieren. Dadurch lassen sich Wiederholende Aufgaben auch gut im [IT-Servicemanagement] einsetzen. xmera Omnia bietet verschiedene Schnittstellen an, die den Austausch mit externen Systemen oder Personen ermöglichen. PDF-Export Der PDF-Export bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgabenlisten, den Verlauf oder Wiki-Seiten als PDF-Datei herunterzuladen. Wiki-Seiten können auch als HTML-Datei oder Text-Datei heruntergeladen werden. CSV-Schnittstelle Die CSV-Schnittstelle ermöglicht einen manuellen Austausch von Listen. Exportiert werden können die Abfragelisten der Objekte und Aufgaben. Dabei ist eine individuelle Anpassung der zu übertragenden Attribute möglich. Die CSV-Importschnittstelle ermöglicht es Aufgaben zu importieren. Das können Maßnahmenkataloge aus eigenen Vorgaben oder anderen Standards oder auch Aufgaben aus einem anderen Ticket-Systemen sein, die in das System integriert werden sollen. API / E-Mail Schnittstelle Dynamischer sind dabei die Online-Schnittstellen wie die E-Mail-Kopplung oder die API, über die dynamisch externe Systeme integriert werden können. Die E-Mail-Schnittstelle ermöglicht es, eingehende E-Mails in eine Aufgabe zu wandeln. Bei der Einhaltung der Format-Regeln, können die E-Mails konkreten Objekten und definierten Aufgabentypen zugeordnet werden. Die API-Schnittstelle in xmera Omnia ermöglicht einen Datenaustausch bei Objekten, Aufgaben und Benutzern. Dabei wird das Anlegen, Ändern, Löschen oder auch Archivieren unterstützt. Die API-Schnittstelle unterstützt dabei sowohl das xml- als auch json-Format. Berechtigungen werden in xmera Omnia auf Ebene der Objekte verwaltet. Zugriff auf ein Objekt erhalten nur jene Benutzer, die dem Objekt zugeordnet wurden. Die Zuordnung wird in der Objektkonfiguration vorgenommen. Dabei wird für einem Benutzer oder eine Gruppe eine passende Rolle gewählt. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, ein Objekt öffentlich zu machen. Damit kann jeder angemeldete Benutzer im System automatisch auf dieses Objekt zugreifen. Die Benutzer, Gruppen und Rollen werden in der Administration gepflegt. Es besteht die Möglichkeit der LDAP-Kopplung. Somit kann zentral festgelegt werden, welche Benutzer Zutritt zum System haben sollen. Der Objektverantwortliche legt dann fest, welche Benutzer mit welchen Rechten als Mitglied auf ein Objekt zugreifen können. Zur Vereinfachung der Mitgliederverwaltung können die Mitglieder vom übergeordneten Objekt geerbt werden. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Zu den sekundären Assets gehören zum Beispiel: Software, Hardware, Kommunikationssysteme, Infrastruktur. Assets werden in xmera Omnia als Objekte erfasst. Diese Objekte können hierarchisch strukturiert werden. So können über den Hierarchiebaum beispielsweise die Aufbauorganisation und damit Verantwortlichkeiten der Organisation abgebildet werden. Alternativ könnten Assets mit gleichem Schutzbedarf analog zu räumlichen Sicherheitszonen im Hierarchiebaum zusammengefasst werden. Neben den hierarchischen Strukturen können auch logische Verknüpfungen (Zusammenhänge zwischen den Objekten) abgebildet werden. Objektverknüpfungen bilden die Basis für die Vererbung des Schutzbedarfs, der in der Schutzbedarfsanalyse auf Ebene der Informationsobjekte oder Geschäftsprozesse ermittelt wird. Beispiel einer Vererbungskette Informationen → werden in einer Anwendung gepflegt → die auf einem Server läuft → der in einem Serverraum → in einem Werksgebäude steht. Über die logischen Strukturen lassen sich so Abhängigkeitsketten von der Information zu all den für die Informationsverarbeitung notwendigen Assets (Objekten) abbilden.

In der DIN ISO/IEC 27001 wird die Lenkung dokumentierter Informationen gefordert. Hier wird insbesondere die Verfügbarkeit und Verwendbarkeit für die Nutzer, die Steuerung des Zugriffs, der Schutz vor nicht autorisierten Änderungen, die Nachverfolgbarkeit von Änderungen aber auch die Abbildung notwendiger Dokumente aus externen Quellen gefordert. xmera Omnia bietet mit dem Modul DMS ein Dokumentenmanagementsystem, mit dem die Zugänglichkeit und Änderbarkeit von Dokumenten gesteuert, Dokumente strukturiert und klassifiziert, Änderungen versioniert und Freigaben über einen Genehmigungsworkflow organisiert und dokumentiert werden können. Das DMS Modul ist in jedem Objekt verfügbar und kann bei Bedarf aktiviert werden. Zugriffssteuerung Dokumente, die für alle Mitarbeiter relevant sind, können in einem eigens dafür vorgesehenen Objekt zentral verwaltet und zugänglich gemacht werden. Der Zugriff auf Dokumente, die dagegen nur für bestimmte Interessensgruppen relevant sind, kann durch eine entsprechende Rechtevergabe gesteuert werden. Das ist sowohl zentral als auch dezentral in Objekten, die als Arbeitsbereiche, Assets oder Projekte genutzt werden, möglich. Durch zuordnen der Dokumente zu Ordnern sowie durch (administrativ erstellbare) Attribute lassen sich die Dokumente leicht strukturieren. Mit Hilfe von Verknüpfungen einzelner Dokumente zu anderen Elementen in xmera Omnia können Dokumente übergreifend den berechtigten Nutzern zugänglich gemacht werden. Versionierung Zentraler Bestandteil des DMS ist die Versionierung. Dokumente, die mit ihren Metadaten erfasst wurden, können nicht direkt verändert werden. Änderungen müssen in einer neuen Version erfolgen. Damit ist eine Änderungsverfolgung jeder Änderung des Dokuments einschließlich seiner Metadaten möglich. Zusätzlich können Dokumente auch vor ungewollten Änderungen geschützt werden. Genehmigungsworkflow Das DMS in xmera Omnia bietet die Möglichkeit, die Freigabe von Dokumenten über einen Genehmigungsworkflow durchzuführen und zu dokumentieren. Ein Genehmigungsworkflow beschreibt den Ablauf des Freigabeprozesses. In xmera Omnia können verschiedene Freigabeprozesse (z.B. für Richtlinien, Handlungsanweisungen oder Betriebshandbücher) abgebildet werden. Wenn für die Pflege von Dokumenten, die einem Objekt zugeordnet werden, keine Funktionen wie die Versionierung, der Freigabeworkflow oder komplexere Ordnerstrukturen benötigt werden, bieten sich die xmera Omnia Module Datei und Dokumente an. Dateien Das Modul Dateien ermöglicht es, einem Objekt Dateien zuzuordnen. Die Liste beinhaltet den Dateinamen, das Datum der Zuordnung, die Anzahl der Downloads (D/L), sowie die sha256 Prüfsumme. Über eine Tooltip wird eine Dateibeschreibung, die beim Upload erfasst wird, dargestellt. Inhalte einfacher Textdateien können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. Dokumente Das Modul Dokumente bietet die Möglichkeit, einem Objekt eine oder mehrere Dokumentensammlungen zuzuordnen. Eine Dokumentensammlung wird charakterisiert durch eine Dokumentenkategorie (Kategorien können über die Administration angepasst werden), eine Dokumentenbeschreibung und eine oder mehrere zugeordnete Dateien (mit einer Dateibeschreibung). Die Dokumentensammlungen lassen sich nach der Dokumentenkategorie, dem Zuordnungsdatum, dem Dokumententitel oder dem Autor (Benutzer der das Dokument angelegt hat) gruppieren. Dokumente können heruntergeladen werden. Inhalte einfacher Textdokumente können direkt am Bildschirm gelesen werden. In jedem Objekt in xmera Omnia kann das Modul Wiki aktiviert werden. Dieses bietet alle typischen Funktionalitäten eines Wiki. Es ermöglicht Informationen und Wissen kollaborativ zu bearbeiten und zu benutzen. Es eignet sich im Umfeld des ISMS, um Handbücher bereitzustellen oder auch Prozess- / Handlungsbeschreibungen zu einem Asset zu dokumentieren. Diagramme und Flowcharts xmera Omnia integriert Drawio (https://www.diagrams.net/) für das Erstellen von Diagrammen und Flowcharts, die in das Wiki integriert werden können. So erstellen Sie leicht verständliche Prozessablaufpläne, bspw. im Rahmen des Notfallmanagements. Auch Netzpläne sind mit Hilfe der zahlreichen Bibliotheken zügig erstellt. Interne Links / Makros Mit Hilfe von internen Verlinkungen und Makros lassen sich Inhalte aus anderen Modulen wie z.B. Dokumente, Aufgaben oder Wikiseiten aus anderen Objekten in einem Wiki übersichtlich zusammenfassen. Historie Die Historie zeigt alle Änderungen, die im Wiki durchgeführt wurden, inkl. dem Bearbeiter und Zeitpunkt.

Eine bedeutsame Schnittmenge stellt dabei das Vorfallmanagement dar. An die Organisation des Vorfallmanagements werden im Anhang A Anforderungen zur Erfassung und Behandlung von Informationssicherheitsvorfällen gestellt. Dieses beinhaltet die Beschreibung des Verfahrens, einen etablierten Meldeprozess, eine zügige Bearbeitung und Beurteilung der Meldungen, eine dem Vorfall entsprechende Reaktion, eine Analyse und Lösungen der Vorfälle. Ein ISMS beinhaltet den Betrieb der Informationssysteme. So fordert die DIN ISO/IEC 27001, dass die betrieblichen Prozesse, die für den sicheren Betrieb notwendig sind, nicht nur umgesetzt sondern auch gesteuert werden müssen. Dazu gehören neben den konkreten Aufgaben, die sich aus den Sicherheitsanforderungen ergeben, auch die Aufgaben aus den Bereichen Wartung, Instandsetzung, Erweiterungen und Änderungen. xmera Omnia unterstützt den gesamten Prozess des Vorfallmanagements. Dazu gehört die automatisierte Zuordnung von eingehenden Meldungen zu einzelnen Mitarbeitern oder Gruppen, die Priorisierung und Gruppierung sowie die Analyse des Vorfalls. Automatisieren In der xmera Omnia Demo ist die Meldungserfassung abgebildet. Meldungen können, genau wie Aufgaben, automatisch einem Bearbeiter oder einer Bearbeitergruppe zugewiesen werden. Die Erstellung einer Meldung kann im System selbst erfolgen oder per E-Mail an das System gesendet werden. Der E-Mail-Empfang ist in der Testinstanz nicht verfügbar. Besteht bereits eine Lösung für das Vorfallmangement (z.B. Ticketsystem) kann über die E-Mail- oder API-Schnittstelle von xmera Omnia eine Kopplung der Systeme erreicht werden. Priorisieren und Gruppieren Die einlaufende Meldung kann je nach Beurteilung anschließend als Aufgabe, Störung oder Vorfall eingestuft werden. Dieser können dann noch sich ergebende Unteraufgaben zugeordnet werden. Der Vorfall läßt sich über die Priorisierung und Kategorisierung weiter strukturieren. Durch Verknüpfungen zu anderen Vorfällen lassen sich auch ähnliche Vorfälle zusammenfassen. Über die Funktion Eigene Felder lassen sich leicht weitere Felder in eine Aufgabe integrieren und so an den Nutzer anpassen. Analysieren Zur Analyse ist in xmera Omnia die 5-W-Methode (5-Why-Methode nach Toyoda Sakichi) implementiert. Dabei wird in 5 Frageschritten der Vorfall aus verschiedenen Aspekten beleuchtet. Ziel ist es, Maßnahmen zu finden, die präventiv einen solchen Vorfall verhindern oder die Auswirkungen verringern. Diese Maßnahmen können wiederum als Unteraufgabe dem Vorfall zugeordnet werden. xmera Omnia bietet mit im Rahmen des Aufgabenmanagements die Möglichkeit aus den Maßnahmen der Sicherheitsanforderungen, der Risikobewertung, der Vorfallanalyse oder den Audits betrieblich umzusetzende Aufgaben zu erstellen und zu überwachen. Planen Aufgaben können bspw. als Abfolge (Vorgänger, Nachfolger) oder unabhängig geplant werden. Sie können zu Arbeitspaketen zusammengefasst werden, um so die Umsetzung einzelner Meilensteine besser beobachten und steuern zu können. Zu jeder Art von Aufgabe lassen sich Unteraufgaben, Kopien oder Verknüpfungen zu bestehenden Aufgaben erstellen. Somit lassen sich Beziehungen zwischen Aufgaben abbilden. Wiederholende Aufgaben planen Sie mit dem gleichnamigen Modul, das in jedem Objekt aktiviert werden kann. Delegieren Aufgaben können Mitarbeitern oder auch Gruppen zugeordnet werden. Jeder Mitarbeiter kann sich im Dashboard \"seine Aufgaben\" anzeigen lassen und erhält damit eine Übersicht auf seine offenen Arbeiten. Im Benutzerprofil hat jeder Mitarbeiter die Möglichkeit eine Option für die automatische E-Mailbenachrichtigung zu wählen, um über Änderungen im System benachrichtigt zu werden. Überwachen In jeder Aufgabe kann der Status und der Umsetzungsgrad dargestellt werden. Diese Werte werden auch an die untergeordneten Aufgaben übertragen. Ein Status einer (Eltern-)Aufgabe kann wiederum vom Status der unterlagerten Aufgaben abhängig gemacht werden. Da xmera Omnia auf einem klassischen Projektmanagementsystem basiert, ist das Ticketsystem integraler Bestandteil. So basieren die Maßnahmen, Risikobeurteilungen oder Aufgaben im engeren Sinne auf diesem Ticketsystem. In der Administration können weitere Aufgabentypen, Bezeichnungen für (Ticket-)Formulare, angelegt und über eigene Felder erweitert werden. Auf diese Weise können auch weitere Prozesse, wie z.B. das Datenschutzmanagement in xmera Omnia integriert werden.

Im Kapitel 6 der ISO/IEC 27001 wird vorgegeben, dass alle Maßnahmen zur Erreichung der Sicherheitsziele zu planen und deren Umsetzung zu überwachen sind. Die Organisation und die getroffenen Maßnahmen sind nach Kapiltel 9 zu bewerten und deren Umsetzung zu überwachen. Anwendbarkeitserklärung Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil eines ISMS ist die Erklärung zur Anwendbarkeit (Statement of Applicability | SOA), in der die Sicherheitsanforderungen zusammengefasst werden, die zur Erreichung der Sicherheitsziele der Organisation relevant sind. Der Katalog der Sicherheitsanforderungen ist dem Anhang A der DIN ISO/IEC 27001 zu entnehmen. Die sich aus den Anforderungen ergebenden Maßnahmen werden ergänzt um weitere Maßnahmen aus eigenen Sicherheitsstandards, der Risikobewertung, der Vorfallanalyse oder internen wie externen Audits. Die Umsetzung der Maßnahmen ist zu überwachen und ihr Umsetzungsgrad zu ermitteln. xmera Omnia bietet den Anforderungskatalog als Importpaket gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27001 Anhang A an, der um individuelle Anforderungen erweitert werden kann. Interne Audits Im Kapitel 9.2 und im Anhang A.12.7 wird die Planung von internen Audits gefordert, in denen überprüft wird, ob die ISMS Prozesse die Anforderungen an die IT-Sicherheit erfüllen und wirksam sind. Der Anforderungskatalog kann an zentraler Stelle importiert und verwaltet werden. Von hier aus können Maßnahmen manuell oder automatisiert auf Assets der Organisation verteilt werden. Durch die Verknüpfung der zentralen Maßnahmenliste mit den operativ dezentral durchzuführenden Maßnahmen, kann der Reifegrad zentral überwacht werden. Die Begründung zur Relevanz von Sicherheitsanforderungen kann direkt in der Sicherheitsanforderung abgebildet werden. Die Anwendbarkeitserklärung kann zur weiteren Verarbeitung oder Vorlage beim Auditor exportiert werden. Status und Umsetzungsgrad Aus dem Anforderungskatalog sind Maßnahmen abzuleiten, zu planen, zu deligieren und zu überwachen. Zu jeder Maßnahme lassen sich Status und Umsetzungsgrad vom Verantwortlichen angeben, wodurch der Informationssicherheitsbeauftragte jederzeit einen Überblick über den Fortschritt erhält. Auswertungen kann er sowohl auf Ebene eines einzelnen Assets vornehmen als auch auf der Ebene von übergeordneten Objekten. In der obersten Ebene erhält er einen Überblick über das gesamte System. Um die Übersichtlichkeit zu erhöhen, lassen sich Aufgabenpakete bilden. Sie fassen Maßnahmen und zugehörige Aufgaben zusammen. Auch bei Aufgabenpaketen werden unterlagerte Maßnahmen und Aufgaben kumuliert dargestellt, so dass auch hier leicht ein Umsetzungsgrad überwacht werden kann. Verknüpfung zwischen Maßnahmen und Aufgaben Maßnahmen können auf verschiedenste Weise verknüpft werden. Der Bearbeitungstatus und der Umsetzungsgrad von untergeordneten Aufgaben ist in den übergeordneten Elementen zu sehen und kann den Status und den Umsetzungsgrad des übergeordneten Elements beeinflussen. Tabellarische und graphische Auswertung Zur Priorisierung und Umsetzungsüberwachung bietet xmera Omnia mehrere Möglichkeiten der Datenauswertung. Dabei unterstützen Filterfunktionen und eine flexible Spaltenanordnung innerhalb der Tabellen. Zusätzliche graphische Auswertungen runden die Analyse ab. Die Maßnahmenzuordnung kann auf drei Wegen erfolgen: Manuell Automatisiert Vorkonfiguration Synchronisation In der Demo haben wir die Synchronisation vorbereitet. Die Zuordnung von umzusetzenden Sicherheitsanforderungen und Maßnahmen zu den betroffenen Objekten erfolgt über eine Synchronisationsfunktion. Dazu werden ihnen vorbereitend die jeweils relevanten Objektklassen (Zielobjekte) zugeordnet. In einem weiteren Schritt können Synchronisationsobjekte definiert werden. Um nicht für jedes Objekt eine eigene (zu bearbeitende) Maßnahmenliste zu erzeugen, kann ein Strukturobjekt im Hierarchiebaum gewählt werden, das alle unterlagerten Objekte zusammenfasst. Bei der Synchronisation wird analysiert, welche Objektklasse(n) dem vorliegenden Objekt zugeordnet sind (eigene Objektklasse und ggf. hierarchisch unterlagerte Objektklassen). Anhand dieser Auswertung werden die Maßnahmen des zentralen Katalogs entweder auf Ebene des Strukturobjekts oder auf Einzelobjektebene synchronisiert. Für die Auswertung von Aufgaben, wie bspw. Maßnahmen, Vorfälle und Störungen, Risikobeurteilungen bietet xmera Omnia durch Abfragen, Berichte, Diagramme und Exportschnittstellen mehrere Möglichkeiten. Tabellenabfragen Ein Anwender kann für Objekte und Aufgaben individuelle Abfragen erstellen. Dafür wählt er die entsprechenden Filter und stellt sich Ergebnistabellen mit den benötigten Attributen als Tabellenspalten und sortierten oder gruppierten Daten zusammen. Diese Abfragen können gespeichert, und für die weitere Verarbeitung als PDF oder csv-Datei exportiert, werden. Berichte / Zusammenfassung In den Aufgabenlisten der Objekte können über die Funktion Zusammenfassung Berichte aufgerufen werden, die in Form von Graphiken und Tabellen verschiedene Informationen darstellen. Die graphischen Auswertungen lassen sich auch im Dashboard anzeigen. Im Rahmen des Informationssicherheitsmanagementsystems (ISMS) gibt es in vielen Bereichen wiederkehrende Aufgaben. Typische Aktivitäten zum Aufbau und Betrieb eines ISMS sind beispielsweise: Monatliche Besprechung und Abstimmung im ISMS-Team Jährliche Überprüfung, Aktualisierung und Fortschreibung der Informationssicherheitsleitlinie Vierteljährliche Überprüfung der Zutrittsrechte Jährliche [Auditplanung] uvm. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie beliebig viele Aufgaben mit individuellen Wiederholungszyklen planen. Zudem können Sie jede wiederkehrende Aufgabe einer Person zuordnen, einen Fertigstellungstermin und die Bearbeitungsdauer planen. Da die Funktion der Wiederholende Aufgaben als Objektmodul konzipiert ist, können Sie sie in jedem beliebigen Objekt aktivieren. Dadurch lassen sich Wiederholende Aufgaben auch gut im [IT-Servicemanagement] einsetzen. Mit xmera Omnia können Sie auch Audits planen und durchführen. Zu den Hilfsmitteln gehören Aufgaben, deren Inhalt um eigene Felder wie z.B. Auditfragen oder Ergebnisse ergänzt werden können, Terminplanungen, Zuordnung von Verantwortlichkeiten, Folgende Funktionen unterstützen bei der Auditplanung und -durchführung. Paket / Stapel Mit der Zuordnung der Aufgaben zu Arbeitspaketen, basierend auf dem Jahresdatum oder dem Zertifizierungszyklus, können die durchzuführenden Audits strukturiert werden. Verlauf und Kalender Mit den Funktionen Kalender und Verlauf lassen sich die geplanten und umgesetzten Audits chronologisch darstellen. Über diesen Weg wird die Planung und der aktuelle Auditstatus besonders übersichtlich. Wiederholende Aufgaben Mit dem Objektmodul der Wiederkehrenden Aufgaben lassen sich im Rahmen der Auditplanung und -durchführung alle Aufgaben, die sich z.B. jährlich wiederholen auf unbestimmte Zeit vorausplanen. Dabei können die Aufgabenvorlagen jederzeit an veränderte Anforderungen angepasst werden. Your browser does not support the video tag. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Hat ein Asset einen Schutzbedarf, der eine weitergehende Analyse erfordert (zumeist Hoch oder Sehr Hoch), so ist eine Risikobewertung durchzuführen. Gegenstand der Bewertung sind die Einschätzung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadenhöhe für ein sicherheitsrelevantes Ereignis. Der berechnete Wert ist das aktuelle Risiko für das vorliegende Ereignis. Dieses Risiko wird dem Risikoappetit der Organisation gegenüber gestellt. Anhand der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix wird über die Risikobehandlung des zugrunde liegenden Ereignisses entschieden. Die sich daraus ergebenden Maßnahmen sind zu definieren und zu priorisieren. Basis für die Risikobeurteilungen in xmera Omnia sind Gefährdungen. Gefährdungen beschreiben verschiedene Bedrohungsarten und verknüpfen sie mit einer potentiellen Schwachstelle. xmera Omnia bietet ein Importpaket des Gefährdungskataloges gemäß DIN ISO/IEC 27005 oder IT-Grundschutz an, das um individuelle Gefährdungen erweitert werden kann. Jede Gefährdung kann verschiedenen Objektklassen zugeordnet werden. Über den Synchronisationsprozess werden die Gefährdungen dann einem Asset oder einer Assetgruppe zugeordnet. Die Risikobewertung erfolgt auf Basis von zugeordneten Gefährdungen. Durch Festlegung der Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und der Schadensklasse wird über die Risikoakzeptanzmatrix ein resultierendes Risiko ermittelt. Risikoakzeptanzmatrix Für die Ermittlung des Risikoniveaus wird in xmera Omnia eine individuell konfigurierbare Risikoakzeptanzmatrix bereitgestellt, in der für jede Kombination aus Eintrittshäufigkeit und Schadensklasse ein Risikoniveau zugeordnet werden kann. In der Demo wird hierfür eine 4 x 4 Matrix verwendet, woraus sich 16 Kombinationen ergeben. Da die Konfiguration der Risikoakzeptanzmatrix im Administrationsbereich vorgenommen werden muss, ist eine Anpassung im Rahmen der Demo nicht möglich. Risikobehandlung Die gewählte Risikobehandlungsoption und das sich daraus ergebende neue Risikoniveau lassen sich ebenfalls in der Risikobeurteilung abbilden. Wird eine Maßnahme erforderlich, kann diese direkt erstellt und mit der Risikobeurteilung verknüpft werden. Wird ein Risikoniveau durch eine Maßnahme reduziert oder vermieden, so kann die Maßnahmen als Unteraufgabe an die Gefährdung gekoppelt werden. Alle Maßnahmen, die aus einer Risikobeurteilung erwachsen sind, können dann in einem Risikobehandlungsplan zusammengefasst werden. Der Risikobehandlungsplan zeigt alle Maßnahmen, die als Ziel haben, dass Schutzniveau auf ein akzeptables Maß zu bringen. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Diese Informationssicherheitsbeurteilung beinhaltet eine erste grobe Einschätzung wie sich verschiedene Informationssicherheitsereignisse in Bezug auf die Schutzziele Vertraulichkeit, Integrität und Verfügbarkeit auf die Organisation auswirken würden, wenn sie eintreten. Je nach Branche oder Sicherheitsstandard können/müssen weitere Schutzziele wie bspw. Authentizität oder Nichtabstreitbarkeit in die Beurteilung einbezogen werden. Die Schutzbedarfsfeststellung in xmera Omnia ermöglicht die Beurteilung des Schutzbedarfs anhand eines Fragenkatalogs. Dieser Fragenkatalog kann individuell angepasst werden. Somit lässt sich zum Beispiel direkt durch die Prozesseigner der Schutzbedarf für die von ihnen benötigten Informationen ermitteln. Aufwendige Interviews entfallen. Der Schutzbedarf der sekundären Assets, wie z.B. Anwendungen, Desktop-PC’s, Server oder auch Serverräume und Gebäude, ist abhängig von den in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen. Über die Struktur der logischen Verknüpfungen im Assetregister lassen sich die Schutzbedarfe der primären Assets (Prozesse und Informationen) auf die sekundären Assets übertragen. Somit haben die Verantwortlichen dieser Assets jederzeit einen Überblick über den Schutzbedarf, der in ihnen verarbeiteten Informationen.

Dazu gehört, dass geplante Änderungen überwacht werden. Je nach Komplexität solcher Änderungen, wie z.B. bei größeren Upgrades, Erneuerungen oder der Einführung neuer IT-Prozesse, ist ein Projektmanagement sinnvoll oder notwendig. Import-/Exportfunktionen Viele Prozesse einer Organisation haben Schnittmengen mit dem ISMS, werden aber nicht im ISMS abgebildet. Sei es die Dokumentation für den externen Auditor, Daten für eine Analyse oder einen Bericht oder ein externes Asset-Register. Hier ist es sinnvoll Schnittstellen, wie z.B. ein Datenimport- und -exportprozess auf Basis von CSV-Tabellen ein PDF-Ausdruck oder eine API-Schnittstelle für einen Online-Datenaustausch. Rollen und Berechtigungen In einem ISMS Tool sind viele sensible Daten abgebildet. Gleichzeitig sind viele Mitarbeiter an der Pflege beteiligt. Die ISMS Software sollte ein Berechtigungssystem bereitstellen, dass hier mit größtmöglicher Flexibilität die Zugriffe auf das System steuern kann. xmera Omnia basiert im Kern auf einem Projektmanagementsystem. Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat. Über Meldungen lassen sich Informationen im Projektteam verteilen. Über Foren lassen sich Diskussionsrunden abbilden. Über das Wiki kann Projektwissen dokumentiert und weitergeben werden. xmera Omnia bietet verschiedene Schnittstellen an, die den Austausch mit externen Systemen oder Personen ermöglichen. PDF-Export Der PDF-Export bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgabenlisten, den Verlauf oder Wiki-Seiten als PDF-Datei herunterzuladen. Wiki-Seiten können auch als HTML-Datei oder Text-Datei heruntergeladen werden. CSV-Schnittstelle Die CSV-Schnittstelle ermöglicht einen manuellen Austausch von Listen. Exportiert werden können die Abfragelisten der Objekte und Aufgaben. Dabei ist eine individuelle Anpassung der zu übertragenden Attribute möglich. Die CSV-Importschnittstelle ermöglicht es Aufgaben zu importieren. Das können Maßnahmenkataloge aus eigenen Vorgaben oder anderen Standards oder auch Aufgaben aus einem anderen Ticket-Systemen sein, die in das System integriert werden sollen. API / E-Mail Schnittstelle Dynamischer sind dabei die Online-Schnittstellen wie die E-Mail-Kopplung oder die API, über die dynamisch externe Systeme integriert werden können. Die E-Mail-Schnittstelle ermöglicht es, eingehende E-Mails in eine Aufgabe zu wandeln. Bei der Einhaltung der Format-Regeln, können die E-Mails konkreten Objekten und definierten Aufgabentypen zugeordnet werden. Die API-Schnittstelle in xmera Omnia ermöglicht einen Datenaustausch bei Objekten, Aufgaben und Benutzern. Dabei wird das Anlegen, Ändern, Löschen oder auch Archivieren unterstützt. Die API-Schnittstelle unterstützt dabei sowohl das xml- als auch json-Format. Berechtigungen werden in xmera Omnia auf Ebene der Objekte verwaltet. Zugriff auf ein Objekt erhalten nur jene Benutzer, die dem Objekt zugeordnet wurden. Die Zuordnung wird in der Objektkonfiguration vorgenommen. Dabei wird für einem Benutzer oder eine Gruppe eine passende Rolle gewählt. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit, ein Objekt öffentlich zu machen. Damit kann jeder angemeldete Benutzer im System automatisch auf dieses Objekt zugreifen. Die Benutzer, Gruppen und Rollen werden in der Administration gepflegt. Es besteht die Möglichkeit der LDAP-Kopplung. Somit kann zentral festgelegt werden, welche Benutzer Zutritt zum System haben sollen. Der Objektverantwortliche legt dann fest, welche Benutzer mit welchen Rechten als Mitglied auf ein Objekt zugreifen können. Zur Vereinfachung der Mitgliederverwaltung können die Mitglieder vom übergeordneten Objekt geerbt werden. Your browser does not support the video tag. Your browser does not support the video tag.

PDF-Export Der PDF-Export bietet die Möglichkeit Aufgabenlisten, den Verlauf oder Wiki-Seiten als PDF-Datei herunterzuladen. Wiki-Seiten können auch als HTML-Datei oder Text-Datei heruntergeladen werden. CSV-Schnittstelle Die CSV-Schnittstelle ermöglicht einen manuellen Austausch von Listen. Exportiert werden können die Abfragelisten der Objekte und Aufgaben. Dabei ist eine individuelle Anpassung der zu übertragenden Attribute möglich. Die CSV-Importschnittstelle ermöglicht es Aufgaben zu importieren. Das können Maßnahmenkataloge aus eigenen Vorgaben oder anderen Standards oder auch Aufgaben aus einem anderen Ticket-Systemen sein, die in das System integriert werden sollen. API / E-Mail Schnittstelle Dynamischer sind dabei die Online-Schnittstellen wie die E-Mail-Kopplung oder die API, über die dynamisch externe Systeme integriert werden können. Die E-Mail-Schnittstelle ermöglicht es, eingehende E-Mails in eine Aufgabe zu wandeln. Bei der Einhaltung der Format-Regeln, können die E-Mails konkreten Objekten und definierten Aufgabentypen zugeordnet werden. Die API-Schnittstelle in xmera Omnia ermöglicht einen Datenaustausch bei Objekten, Aufgaben und Benutzern. Dabei wird das Anlegen, Ändern, Löschen oder auch Archivieren unterstützt. Die API-Schnittstelle unterstützt dabei sowohl das xml- als auch json-Format.","title":"Import / Export","component":"xmera-omnia-demo-guide","version":"latest","name":"import-export","url":"/xmera-omnia-demo-guide/latest/shared/sonstiges/import-export.html","titles":[]},"184":{"id":184,"text":"xmera Omnia basiert im Kern auf einem Projektmanagementsystem. Der Funktionsumfang reicht von der Aufgabenplanung über Abbildung von Abhängigkeiten bis hin zu Kollaborationsfunktionen, die die Zusammenarbeit im Projekt unterstützen. Aufgabenplanung Die Abwicklung von Projekten wird zu einem Großteil durch die Strukturierung und Zuweisung von Aufgaben umgesetzt. Diesen Aufgaben können Zeiten und Mitarbeiter, Verantwortliche aber auch Umsetzungsaufwand zugeordnet werden. Mit der Abbildung von Status und Umsetzungsgrad, ist ein effektives Projektmanagement möglich. Zur Strukturierung können auch Aufgabepakete angelegt werden, die Aufgaben zusammenfassen und damit das Projektcontrolling vereinfachen. Durch die Dokumentenverwaltung lassen sich Projektdokumente zentral verwalten und können komfortabel allen Beteiligten bereit gestellt werden. Durch die Integration der betrieblichen Projekte in xmera Omnia ist die Forderung aus dem ISMS, den ISB stets einzubinden, leicht umgesetzt. Terminplanung / Projektverlauf Durch die Verknüpfung von Aufgaben als Vorgänger von bzw. Nachfolger von lassen sich Abläufe abbilden. Somit werden abhängige Aufgaben bei Verschiebung des Vorgängers ebenfalls verschoben. Die Beziehungen zwischen Projekten und Unterprojekten, Paketen, Aufgaben und Unteraufgaben und die Abhängigkeiten von Aufgaben lassen sich mit Status und Umsetzungsgrad im Verlauf (Gantt-Diagramm) abbilden. Zusammenarbeit / Kollaboration Der Informationsaustausch zwischen den Beteiligten ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. xmera Omnia bietet in diesem Zusammenhang einige Funktionen, die diesen Informations-/Wissenstransfer unterstützen: Das Journal zeigt an, wo sich in letzter Zeit etwas im Projekt verändert hat. Über Meldungen lassen sich Informationen im Projektteam verteilen. Über Foren lassen sich Diskussionsrunden abbilden. Über das Wiki kann Projektwissen dokumentiert und weitergeben werden.","title":"Projektmanagement","component":"xmera-omnia-demo-guide","version":"latest","name":"projekt-management","url":"/xmera-omnia-demo-guide/latest/shared/sonstiges/projekt-management.html","titles":[]},"185":{"id":185,"text":"Berechtigungen werden in xmera Omnia auf Ebene der Objekte verwaltet.

Damit kann jeder angemeldete Benutzer im System automatisch auf dieses Objekt zugreifen. Die Benutzer, Gruppen und Rollen werden in der Administration gepflegt. Es besteht die Möglichkeit der LDAP-Kopplung. Somit kann zentral festgelegt werden, welche Benutzer Zutritt zum System haben sollen. Der Objektverantwortliche legt dann fest, welche Benutzer mit welchen Rechten als Mitglied auf ein Objekt zugreifen können.
